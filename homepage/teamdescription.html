		After relaxing for 2 years, we are back in the game with an exciting new idea and 13 motivated young students. We hope, you enjoy our iGEM42-software-tool â€“ in case you do so, please do not hesitate to tell us. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to send an eMail. <br><br>
Besides this software-tool, we focus on NRPS (non-ribosomal peptide synthetases). "DNA makes RNA makes Protein", the central dogma of molecular biology is not the entire truth. There is a second option for cells to produce proteins - the nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS). This pathway of peptide formation is independent of ribosomes and one non-ribosomal peptide, delftibactin, became of special interest in 2013. It is produced by the extremophile bacterium Delftia acidovorans and it is capable of precipitating gold from solution. <br><br>
Gold is an essential part of all electronic devices. In 2007, German electronic waste contained an estimated amount of 1.9 to 2.4 tons of the precious metal. Yet, only 28% of it were recovered. The bacterium D. acidovorans was recently dicovered to precipitate and reduce Au3+ ions to solid gold. This is enabled by the non-ribosomal peptide Delftibactin, which is produced by non-ribosomal sythetases. We are going to incorporate the entire Delftibactin NRPS pathway into E. coli and enable its secretion by introducing inner and outer membrane transporters for Delftibactin. Hereby, we will efficiently and effortlessly recycle solid gold from electronic waste.<br><br> 
We wish to share the enormous potential of NRPSs (the opportunity to craft engineered, short peptides like antibiotics, natural colors and natural catalysts) with the iGEM community by establishing a standard system for NRPSs. Therefore, we are going to prove substitutability of individual NRPS domains of different species as well as their independent composability. Finally, we are going the develop a software tool to predict the sequence of NRPS domains needed to create any, by the user desired and given NRP.<br><br>
If you want to learn more about our team and our lab project we would be more than glad to welcome you on our wiki or on our official facebook page on which you can follow our progress. <br><br>
