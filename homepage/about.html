		The Wikis of previous iGEM Teams offer an unimaginable pool of experience, expertise and information. Unfortunately, it is both, hard to see through and plenty of work to scroll through all wikis in order to search for the information required. We therefore proudly present iGEM42, the software-tool by Team Heidelberg 2013.
iGEM 42 provides a number of useful apps for iGEM participants, sponsors and everyone who is interested in several aspects of iGEM. Hence, we provide the possibility to acquire information and trends quickly and easily. This project offers: <br><br>

<b>I.	Facts and Figures</b><br><br>

This application will help you acquiring data about the history of iGEM and the tradition of certain teams. You can choose, whether you would like to see the results in a timeline or a Scatter Plot. Besides of the fun-factor, this app will be helpful for teams that are interested in the current trends of the competition, as well as for sponsors who may use those trends for their decision of sponsoring a team.<br><br>

<b>II.	Methods </b><br><br>

In general, this application will promote collaborations between teams. If a team wants to     use or establish a new method and needs help, this team could use the methods-app for finding student expertise, hence teams from the past with experience in this methods. This app will therefore facilitate the search for help – from students for students.<br><br>
