[{"abstract": "Two major hurdles facing the development of complex genetic logic circuits are device connectibility and device extensibility.  Connectibility refers to the ability to connect the output of one device to the input of another device, while extensibility refers to the dual abilities to rationally design new devices and combine multiple devices in one organism.  Our project uses terminator/attenuator (T/A) hairpin sequences (gates) to control transcription and anti-sense RNA as input/output signals to/from the devices.  We call this approach Terminator/Attenuator anti-sense Logic (T/AasL \u2013 pronounced \u201ctaw-ssel\u201d).  It solves the connectibility problems of common protein-based approaches because the anti-sense output of one device is used to disrupt formation of T/A hairpin structures of downstream devices, thus activating them.  In addition, because RNA secondary structures can be rationally designed (using our m-fold derived analysis program) we can readily construct a large family of devices with minimal cross-talk for inclusion in a single cell.\n", "year": ["2008"], "link": ["http://2008.igem.org/Team:Alberta_NINT"], "name": ["Alberta"], "title": ["Project Logi-col[i]: Terminator/Attenuator anti-sense Logic (T/AasL)"]},

By co-culturing populations of inducer-synthesizing cells and pulse-generating receiver cells, we hope to achieve self-sustaining oscillatory gene expression dynamics that could render long term culture-based recombinant protein synthesis more sustainable. This would open the door for the production of considerably toxic proteins for numerous applications including anti-cancer therapeutics and antiseptics.\n", "year": ["2008"], "link": ["http://2008.igem.org/Team:University_of_Ottawa"], "name": ["University"], "title": ["A Pulse Generator in Yeast for Sustained Expression of Recombinant Proteins"]},

However, it is virtually unknown between unicellular organisms, much less between unicellular organisms of different kingdoms of life. Our team has constructed a system that allows for interspecies, bacteria-to-yeast optical communication. To permit bacteria to send an optical signal, we expressed in E. coli a red firefly luciferase under IPTG induction. In yeast, we used a yeast-two-hybrid-system based on the interaction between the red-light-sensitive Arabidopsis thaliana phytochrome PhyB and its interacting factor PIF3. Interaction between PhyB and PIF3 is induced by the red light from the bacteria, resulting in transcription of the lacZ gene. This is an excellent demonstration of the principles and potential of synthetic biology: this system not only allows for interspecies optical communication, but enables us to optically bridge a physically separated canonical lac operon using light as a trans-acting factor.\n", "year": ["2009"], "link": ["http://2009.igem.org/Team:Harvard"], "name": ["Harvard"], "title": [" Interspecies Optical Communication Between Bacteria and Yeast"]},

Invasin causes uptake of the bacterium into the mammalian cell by induction of endocytosis. Bacterial cells are lysed in the endosome and then LLO is released. LLO is a pore-forming toxin which causes endosomal membrane disruption and release of the payload (either protein or DNA) into cytoplasm of the mammalian cell. In order to fine-tune expression of genes used in our project we conducted measurement of various RBS parts included in 2010 spring distribution both from Community and Anderson's collections.

{"abstract": "There are challenges using plants in iGEM, namely growth time and the complexity with adapting synthetic biology approaches for plants. However, plants are a major focus of synthetic biology due to their potential use in an array of applications from food security to synthesis of biofuels. The short time scale of the iGEM competition has often meant that plant based projects are challenging and there have been very few in previous years. As the first iGEM team at UEA and in co-operation with the JIC, we felt that we could make a significant contribution to plant based synthetic biology. The overall aim of our project is to help develop and where possible pioneer some of the fundamental technologies and methodologies needed to make plant based synthetic biology projects possible. To achieve this we hope to adapt existing synthetic biology approaches which are successful in Escherichia coli for use in plants.\n", "year": ["2011"], "link": ["http://2011.igem.org/Team:UEA-JIC_Norwich"], "name": ["UEA-JIC_Norwich"], "title": ["The evolution of synthetic biology; The introduction of new photosynthetic eukaryotes as model organisms."]},

{"abstract": "Our work aims at implementing the engineering concept of closed-loop control in E. coli, exploiting quorum sensing. As a proof of concept, we designed a simple genetic controller that regulates the concentration of 3OC6-HSL signalling molecule around  a user-defined set-point. The controlled variable (3OC6-HSL) increases as a function of the exogenous anhydroTetracycline input, that triggers LuxI expression. The controller senses the 3OC6-HSL concentration and activates the production of AiiA, that degrades it.\nTo observe the desired behaviour, a fine tuning of the system was necessary.  The transcriptional/translational strength of the regulatory elements (promoter+RBS in several combinations) and the enzyme activities were measured and exploited to identify a mathematical model able to predict the behaviour of the controlled system. These predictions made possible an in silico rational fine tuning of the circuit: the most promising modules were selected and assembled into the final circuit, avoiding a cost and time expensive combinatorial approach. \n", "year": ["2011"], "link": ["http://2011.igem.org/Team:UNIPV-Pavia"], "name": ["UNIPV-Pavia"], "title": ["Ctrl+E. - Signalling is nothing without control "]},
{"abstract": "The synbiome project exploits synthetic biology to obtain a synthetic stable community of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Two different bacterial strains \u2018A\u2019, \u2018B\u2019 and one eukaryotic cell type \u2018C\u2019 will be engineered to establish mutualism: \u2018A\u2019 produces a N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) sensed by \u2018B\u2019, which in turn produces a different AHL sensed by \u2018A\u2019. In addition, both bacterial cells activate,  through AHL, an enzyme necessary to convert cellobiose to glucose, which represents the only energy source for the whole consortium. The eukaryotic cell \u2018C\u2019 responds to AHL through a hybrid protein, thereby producing a secreted beta-lactamase, which allows the bacterial cells to grow in the presence of ampicillin. The creation of a consortium of inter-dependent cells from different kingdoms is expected to pave the way to multiple applications, since different cells might cooperate and, for instance, better produce complex molecules.\n", "year": ["2011"], "link": ["http://2011.igem.org/Team:UNITS_Trieste"], "name": ["UNITS_Trieste"], "title": ["Synbiome: a three-cell type interkingdom consortium"]},

The cleaning of E. coli will be possible thanks to the colicin protein. The activity of these proteins will be controlled by a biological pH-stat, using light-driven cyanobacteria to control pH of the media.\nWe will deliver a DIY kit as a prototype platform for killing pathogens responsible of diseases such as cholera, diarrhea and typhoid fever, ending with more than 2 million deaths in the last year according to the 2011 WHO Guidelines for Drinking-Water Quality.\n", "year": ["2011"], "link": ["http://2011.igem.org/Team:Valencia"], "name": ["Valencia"], "title": ["\"Water Colicin Cleaner: disinfected water by E. coli\""]},
{"abstract": "One aim of Synthetic biology is to re-engineer naturally occurring gene circuits to produce artificial systems that behave predictably. Our project involved streamlining and providing additional functionality to a recently published synchronized oscillatory circuit, in an attempt to reproduce and further characterize its dynamics. Our genetic circuit consists of modified (and BioBricked) elements of the Vibrio fischeri lux quorum sensing system composed to form interconnected positive and negative feedback loops, which dynamically regulate the expression of GFP. In order to provide our E. coli host with the right environment required for population-wide oscillations, we designed and manufactured a custom flow-chamber capable of maintaining a defined cell population while independently varying the growth conditions. The chamber was specifically designed for time-lapse studies with a fluorescence microscope. We detected synchronized oscillatory gene expression under zero-flow conditions, suggesting an unexpected level of robustness. This should facilitate its integration with more advanced genetic circuits.\n", "year": ["2011"], "link": ["http://2011.igem.org/Team:Wageningen_UR"], "name": ["Wageningen_UR"], "title": ["The Synchroscillator: Controlling and Visualizing Synchronized Oscillations in Real Time"]},
{"abstract": "Our goal is to set up an easy and quick protocol for cell free cloning. It skips plasmid propagation in bacteria. This speeds up the cloning procedure at least three times and allows cloning of toxic genes. We make sure that no bacteria get harmed during our project. Moreover we have measured the RBS parts with various fluorescent proteins and they are not as standard as we would like them to be. The strength of a RBS part depends on the protein used. Why? Because the beginning of the protein influences the mRNA fold. We came up with the idea of RBS parts fused with short 'protein beginnings' -  expression adapters. Using genetic algorithm we designed expression adapters that would provide standardized protein expression or increase expression of your favorite protein.

{"abstract": "Bacterial chemotaxis is controlled via a signalling cascade, where CheZ is a protein integral in the directed movement of bacteria towards a stimulus. The aim was to control chemotaxis such that bacteria will be attracted to a defined substance followed by the ability to travel back to another stimulus at the start location, upon activation of an IPTG inducible toggle switch. Two riboswitches were used to control the translation of a CheZ fluorescent protein fusion, the first sensitive to theophylline and the second to atrazine. Fluorometry was used to prove the activation of the riboswitches. A theophylline concentration of 1.5mM resulted in the highest expression of the fusion protein. Motility experiments indicated that CheZ mutants regained motility in the presence of theophylline. Since riboswitches can be engineered for many substances, this system has possible applications as a networking template in multiple situations, be they industrial or medical.\n", "year": ["2011"], "link": ["http://2011.igem.org/Team:WITS-CSIR_SA"], "name": ["WITS-CSIR_SA"], "title": ["Biotweet: A riboswitch controlled location-based networking framework"]}]
