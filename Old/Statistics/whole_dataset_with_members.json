To engineer bacteria we designed a genetic flip-flop composed of a binary memory (toggle switch) and an UV sensitive trigger. We chose UV to have a fine spatial selectivity in programming the cells and IPTG  to reset the memory. We designed a circuit with high UV sensitivity by computer-model analysis. Core elements of the genetic memory are two mutually regulated promoters, designed as independent operator sites flanking a constitutive promoter. Thus, promoter transcriptional strength and repressor binding affinity can be independently fixed. Operator libraries for LacI, TetR, Lambda and LexA repressors were cloned as BioBricks to allow the rational design of regulated promoters that is still lacking in the Registry We expect this approach to be a benefit in many  Synthetic Biology applications.\n",

The limiter network reacts to the transcription of an endogenous gene within each cell, entering a regulatory state only where and when the rate of transcription lies beyond an acceptable range of activity.

We have designed the genetic circuitry to establish a two-component Reaction-Diffusion system involving the well-characterised Lux and Agr signalling pathways, and we have modelled the intercellular interactions between these pathways to produce complex self-organising designs known as Turing patterns. To support this system we have developed the gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis as a BioBrick chassis, including direct chromosomal single-copy insertion, peptide signalling, and BioBrick-compatible vectors for expression in both gram-negative and -positive bacteria. We have also tested a new assembly method for rapidly generating constructs by joining multiple PCR fragments.

Senders produce signaling molecules, and receivers are activated only after a particular concentration of this\u3000molecule is reached. Although different quorum sensing species have slightly different signaling molecules, these molecules are not completely specific to their hosts and cross-species reactivity is observed. Communication using non endogenous molecules is less sensitive, and requires a higher signal concentration to take effect. This results in slower activation of receivers.\n",

Firstly, biologically produced plastics such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are superior to petroleum-based plastics because they are both biodegradable and biocompatible. By focusing on modulating the ratio of two PHA monomers, 3-hydroxybutyrate and 4-hydroxybutyrate, the copolymer poly(3HB-co-4HB) can be created featuring increased elasticity and utility over any particular PHA monomer. Secondly, a novel polyethylene-degradation pathway is being engineered based on the oxidation of long-chain alkanes by alkane monooxygenase LadA. The region inhibiting the binding and catalysis of polyethylene has been computationally identified and site-directed mutagenesis is being conducted at this region to yield a mutant of LadA that oxidizes polyethylene and thereby increases its biodegradability. The combination of the production of an eco-friendly bioplastic with the degradation of petroleum-based plastics is a promising method of waste reduction.\n",

Given the present food and energy shortages, the advantages of such a process are clear. With this in mind, Edinburgh iGEM 2008 have devised systems for E. coli to degrade cellulose into glucose, to upregulate glycogen and terpenoid production, and to convert glycogen into starch. We have also designed software capable of generating a model in SBML format from a list of genes and promoters entered by the user.

Genetically encoded networks drive many of these patterning processes. Furthermore, developmental studies have highlighted the importance of gradient formation  and cell-cell communication for the generation of cellular patterns in the early stages of life. It has been shown that simple networks can form both static and dynamic patterns. Nonetheless, a system whose pattern formation is dependent on combinations of multiple signals has yet to be demonstrated. Here we address this question by designing a network, involving two different quorum-sensing based signaling mechanisms. Upon introduction in E.coli, the system can sense the relative amounts of two input molecules. Using a pre-define set of rules which was selected on its ability to generate spatial patterns, the cell can then express its final state by emitting red or green fluorescence and transmit its state to its neighbors. \n",

This model organism as chassis offers ideal conditions as it has been the primary source for studies on the cell cycle. More specifically, we want to construct a toggle switch that is triggered by cell cycle dependent factors. The construction consists of two subassemblies of identical composition, each with a positive feedback loop for the own expression pattern and a repression of the competing module. Switching is achieved by directed degradation of transcription factors at a specific time frame within the cell cycle. This should result in a binary expression pattern like for example GFP expression in every other cell cycle (0-1-0-1). The system shall be extendable by adding further \"bits\" of similar construction (e.g. for the second bit the pattern 0-0-1-1). The device would thus be an approach to a binary cell division counter.\n",

Transmembrane proteins control proliferation, differentiation, and cellular response and are key for the formation of multicellular organisms. Controlling such proteins enables one to modify cellular behavior and ultimately program cells at will. The complex rules for transmembrane signaling often require engagement of several proteins in a fine-tuned spatial and temporal manner. To tap into the possibilities of transmembrane programming, the Freiburg 2008 iGEM team provides an extensible system comprising an external framework with spatial resolution, a concept for modifying natural receptors, and a modular set of fusion-Biobricks for the construction of synthetic receptors. Spatial resolution in nanometer scale is provided by DNA-Origami modified with distinct patterns and combinations of ligands. Receptors are decoupled from their natural ligands by fusion with artificial binding domains. The Biobrick collection contains signal sequences, binding domains, transmembrane domains, and effector domains featuring split enzymes and split fluorescent proteins for immediate readout.\n",

Communicating the number of neighbors is  implemented using the well-known HSL quorum sensing system. A novel  component is the circuit implementing the automaton's ruleset, to determine  the state to switch to upon detecting \"too few\" , \"enough\"  or \"too many\" neighbors. This \"interval switch\" was designed and implemented by altering the binding site affinity of the signal molecule complexes to correspond to the levels of HSL coming from the neighbors. Finally, the \"ON\" state of the cells is indicated by GFP production and production of new HSL signals, and the \"OFF\" state by their absence.

We attempted to control current production in mtrB knockouts by introducing mtrB on lactose, tetracycline, and heat inducible systems.

Bacteria have evolved 'generalized stress responses' which generate genome-wide changes as responses to globally-integrated information. Specific types of stress upregulate specific 'alternative \u03c3 factors', which activate transcription by binding to nucleotide signatures at the -10 and -35 boxes of their cognate promoters. We set out to design, construct, and validate a library of \u03c3 dependent promoters for E.coli, with the following specifications: the promoters must conform to the BioBrick standard; they must be modular so they can be used multiply in devices; and they must be LacI repressed but \u03c3 dependent, off by default but behaving like native \u03c3 dependent promoters in the presence of IPTG. We're currently characterizing the library of promoters (\u03c324, \u03c328, \u03c332 and \u03c338) against the unmodified Lutz-Bujard promoter, using spectrophotometry and fluorescence microscopy.\n",

We are engineering a bimolecular fluorescence system in which two halves of a fluorescent protein, each fused to an antigenic epitope, will bind to the two sites on an antibody in human serum to cause a detectable fluorescent signal when antibodies against this specific antigen are present. These proteins can be produced in bulk through a bacterial expression system. We are also pursuing similar diagnostic objectives using a eukaryotic system; we are designing strains of yeast able to respond specifically to immunogenic epitopes or antibodies, and activate a fluorometric or enzymatic response accordingly. We are fusing antibodies against immunological targets to cell surface receptors of transcriptional signaling pathways, which would become activated only in the presence of these pathogens.\n",

Dr. Coli senses the disease signal and produces the appropriate amount of drugs to meet the individual patient's needs. And when the patient is cured, Dr. Coli self-destructs. To do this, a molecular timer registers the time since the last disease signal sensed. But when the disease flares up again, this timer is reset and drug production is resumed. Within the time frame of the iGEM competition, we developed a proof of concept of Dr. Coli. The most important assets are massive reuse of standard biobricks, different control mechanisms and extensive modeling.\n",

Our project started with the gigantic goals of lifting up the Titanic from the deep-sea with bacterial power. We worked towards engineering cells to carry larger objects and have been designing and constructing cells so that these micro-order entities can move a centimeter or larger objects. We have equipped E. coli with the ability to attach to an object surface, cell density dependent buoyancy production and regulated flagella, and examined by quantitating the parameters to what extent our goal is achieved.

This will be read by a computer and, depending on the value, emit a sound. This way, bacteria are \"singing\"! The RcnA gene is placed under the control of phage lambda's CI repressor, which is itself produced in the presence of AHL and LuxR. LuxR is produced constitutively in the cell, so the addition of AHL will be the input signal and limiting step. The final objective is to express the extent of RcnA's repression (and so the extracellular nickel concentration) as a function of AHL present in the cell.\n",

The design uses the leverage of existing biobricks of red light bacterial photography system, positive feedback loops and riboswitches. We propose that the architecture presented should scale well with increasing number of genes to be temporally regulated.

We are working on constructing a synthetic clock, affectionately deemed \"The Sequestilator,\" that is analogous to the mammalian clock.  Our clock consists of two parts: an activator with constitutive expression and a promoter that drives the production of a repressor that binds and \"sequesters\" the activator away from the promoter. While intuitively it seems that this system may reach a steady state rather than oscillate, simulations have shown that under certain rapid equilibrium and tight binding conditions, this circuit does exhibit oscillations.

This is a prevalent medical problem that has effected  \na wide population. The team intends to achieve its objective by engineering a biological system that i) produces Colicin E7 through the regulation of LacI gene, and ii) releases E7 through lysis upon detection of symptoms and presence of pathogenic E. Coli. The production of the lysis protein functions under the control of an AND gate, and the inputs are Fe2+ ions (attributed to presence of blood) and Ai2 (attributed to presence of O157:H7). The team intends to characterize the parts and devices used and developed, and to understand the system via computational modeling.\n",

The aim of our project is to introduce a logical order of expression of genes within the context of an oscillating system. In our system the period of oscillation would allow the sequential switching of three genes in a \"FIFO\u00a0: First In, First Out\" manner. This FIFO behavior is implemented as a network of Feed-Forward Loop motives. For this purpose we chose to base our synthetic FIFO system on the naturally existing E. coli flagella system where FIFO of the flagellar machinery genes expression was demonstrated. The FIFO system is then coupled at the population level to an oscillator based on the las quorum sensing system. In parallel we established quantitative computational models with experimentally measured parameters to explore the dynamics of this system.\n",

This is largely regulated through control of gene expression based on the response of regulatory elements to sugars available to the cell. In E. coli, the xylose metabolism operon is controlled by both the xylose-inducible XylR activator protein and the cAMP receptor protein (CRP). In this project we attempt to eliminate glucose control over xylose-inducible gene expression in E. coli by altering the natural transcriptional control region of the xylose operon. Designs constructed and tested include scrambling the CRP binding site, increasing the strength of the xyl promoter, and over expressing XylR. Xylose-inducible gene expression that functions independently of glucose regulation provides a useful approach to improving microbial utilization of biomass feedstocks containing mixtures of glucose and xylose.\n",

We arrange populations of three types of genetically engineered neurons in a topology that implements a (very fast) bi-stable toggle switch.  Pacemaker cells serve as the \u2018power source\u2019 and constantly transmit excitatory dopamine-based action potentials to the other two cells types.

The functionality of this thermometer relies on the post-transcriptional regulation of a temperature-sensitive RNA structure. It opens and enables the ribosome to bind, only when the temperature exceeds a certain threshold. We designed new artificial temperature sensitive RNA sequences, and developed protocols, using luciferase as a reporter, to test their functionality. For the colour output, we built upon the existing carotene biosynthesis pathway and converted all new elements to the BioBrick standard. Furthermore, we developed mathematical models describing both the temperature sensitive parts and the colour mevalonate pathway, and estimated parameters using the experimental data.

        "abstract": "The cells of higher eukaryotes utilize chromatin state to encode \"permanent\" epigenetic changes in gene expression.  For example, signals received by a cell during the course of development can induce the partitioning of the genome into accessible (euchromatin) and inaccessible (heterochromatin) regions that specify the fate of that cell.  This epigenetic profile, in which blocks of gene are \"silenced\" by heterochromatin, is stably maintained and inherited by daughter cells.  Thus, chromatin state provides a higher level of gene expression control that is regional (many genes at once), dominant over transcription factors, ultra-cooperative (all or none), and highly stable (memory).  We have constructed and characterized a synthetic silencing system in S. cerevisiae that inducibly silences specific loci in the genome. This foundational technology will facilitate the construction of complex genetic circuits with memory, and has potential application in the engineering of cell differentiation in higher eukaryotes.\n",

        "abstract": "Damage to inaccessible pipe systems, such as computer cooling circuits, is difficult to rectify. An Escherichia coli synthetic biology circuit for pipe repair was designed. Pipe breach detection and the restoration of pipe integrity were implemented through exploitation of chemotaxis, and cell lysis that releases a two-component protein-based glue (lysyl oxidase and tropoelastin). Control was achieved using an AND gate with quorum sensing and the lac inducer IPTG (released from the breach) as inputs. Deterministic and stochastic models of the genetic circuit, integrated with an agent-based model of E.coli cells, were used to define the effective radii of cell migration and timing of lysis. Constructed AND gate, quorum sensing and lysis timing modules were experimentally tested. The two-component glue concept was successfully validated using in vitro alpha-omega complementation of beta-galatosidase activity. Finally, a proposal for an igem.org-based parameter database was developed to aid the rapid identifation of BioBricks parameter values.\n",

In Silico modelling tools are needed to assess the performance of artificial networks prior to assembly. Genome biofabrication must achieve rates well beyond existing methods using a modular design so that the extent to which natural systems can be made artificial can be tested. We have taken our first steps towards these goals by directing our efforts to the rational refactoring of the E. coli genome. Using flux balance analysis we have identified 117 new genes that may be essential for survival. We have developed and validated a rapid, modular biofabrication method (BioBytes) and have produced BioBytes for 150 of  our 447 essential gene list. We have also built a Lego Mindstorm-based DIY biofab robot and extended the concept to a BioFab-on-a-chip prototype.\n",

Multiplexing is a process where one of multiple input signals is conveyed into a single output channel, whereas in demultiplexing a single input signal is conveyed into one of multiple output channels. The choice of input channel in multiplexing and output channel in demultiplexing is controlled by a selector. The devices implementing these functions are called Multiplexer (Mux) and Demultiplexer (Demux) respectively. In a digital framework, signals can only assume 0/1 values and then the two components can be represented as logic networks. To reach our goal, we chose a biological implementation for all the logic gates involved in the networks and we connected these biological gates to build up two genetic circuits that behave respectively as a 2:1 Mux and a 1:2 Demux, that can be used in several contexts.\n",

In this project we aim to control, over time and space, the production of proteins tagged with a silver-binding peptide for in situ silver nanoparticle nucleation inside microdroplets generated by microfluidic devices. Combining a transcription-translation system with protein coding genes and a recombination logic inside microdroplets provides spatial control. Moreover, in the microfluidic chamber we can pinpoint the beginning of synthesis, and easily track and isolate the droplets. Site-specific recombination generates a molecular timer for temporal control of protein synthesis. Unlike transcriptional regulation, this method gives true all-or-none induction due to covalent modification of DNA by Flp recombinase. Determining the transfer curve of inter-FRT site distance versus average recombination time allows the onset of gene expression to be predicted. We then apply this Flp reporter system as a powerful PoPS measurement device.\n",

We designed the T-REX device, composed of two non-coding DNA sequences: the TRANS-repressor and the CIS-repressing parts. TRANS-repressor acts as a silencer of CIS-repressing RNA target. This target includes a region complementary to the TRANS-repressor sequence antisense, ends with RBS, and is assembled upstream of the coding sequence to be silenced. Upon binding of TRANS-repressor and CIS-repressing RNAs, the access to RBS by ribosomes is hampered, silencing translation. Accordingly, the amount of TRANS-repressor controls the translation rate of the regulated gene. The TRANS-repressor sequence was determined by a computational analysis performed to minimize the interference with the genomic mRNAs and to maximize the base-pairing interaction to the CIS-repressing RNA.  The T-REX device is proposed as a universal and fast switch in synthetic gene circuits.\n",

        "abstract": "To date, efforts to design a whole-cell biosensor capable of detecting levels of one or more biological inputs and responding in an analog mode has been elusive.  We have designed a system of synthetic constructs implemented in an E. coli chassis that will allow detection of continuously varying levels of a single metabolic input and report on the concentration with qualitative output depending on threshold levels of the input.  Our system design utilizes RNA-level hairpin hybridization and antisense technologies linked to various reporters.  Because our approach is modular and does not depend on either endogenous protein processing or exogenous RNA, we envision that such a system could find applications in many different fields, including environmental sensing, detection of diagnostic of therapeutic biomarkers, and systems biology. \n",

        "abstract": "The 2009 Brown iGEM Team aims to treat allergic rhinitis (hay fever) by engineering Staphylococcus epidermidis to secrete a histamine-binding protein, rEV131, in response to elevated histamine concentrations during an allergic attack. rEV131 was cloned from a species of tick, Rhipicephalus appendiculatus. We are putting the rEV131 gene into an endogenous element of human nasal flora, Staphylococcus epidermidis. rEV131 will have a secretion tag specific for S. epidermidis. To synchronize rEV131 production with elevation of histamine concentration, we are computationally designing a novel histamine receptor. This histamine-responsive receptor will induce expression of rEV131. Although S. epidermidis is a non-pathogenic species, when it reaches a certain population threshold it produces potentially hazardous biofilms. To mitigate this concern, we have engineered safety measures that prevent excessive growth by repurposing S. epidmidis\u2019 natural population sensor to cue each cell\u2019s \"suicide\" when a population has reached a dangerous size.\n",

The battery owes its capabilities to two strains of bacteria: the heterotroph Rhodoferax ferrireducens, and the photoautotroph Rhodopseudomonas palustris. Each strain will occupy its own concentration cell and after being cultured anaerobically, will either oxidize (in the case of R. palustris) ferris iron or reduce (in the case of R. ferrireducens) ferric iron. The resulting current will be collected and used to demonstrate the functionality of the battery. The reduction and oxidation reaction will be self-substaining. This process is further aided by the genetic modification of R. palustris. As a photosynthetic prokaryote, R. palustris generates glucose readily. We intend to share this glucose with R. ferrireducens by inserting a passive glucose transporter into the cells of R. palustris.\n",

Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains genetically modified to express wild type UCP-1, mutant sequences with increased uncoupling activity, as well as a control strain were cultured in an Liquid Culture Calorimeter (LCC) we developed. The system consisted of a modified thermo flask with an inserted thermocouple allowing real-time accurate temperature measurements. Different conditions, such as initial densities, amounts of inductor, or shaking speeds were tested. We succeeded to obtain significant temperature increases in the mutant strains compared with the other strains.  We also developed an effective model of our system. Although the system is not always stable and might be sensitive to external perturbations, this is the first time a significant increase in temperature associated to UCP-1 expression in yeast is reported.\n",

Tightly-regulated control of any given set of related transcriptional, translational and posttranslational events will likely require a combination of powerful strategies. Therefore, the 2008 Virginia iGEM team is developing a library of transcriptional terminators intentionally redesigned to be functionally inefficient. Well-characterized, standardized terminators of various efficiencies should allow finely-tuned transcription attenuation and represents yet another step toward global biological control. This work complements other gene expression control methods that focus on initiation of transcription. The desired result is quantitative control of transcript levels, which is often necessary to balance flux through a synthetic metabolic pathway. To demonstrate its potential for real-world application, the team is planning to employ this approach to control the expression of a heterologous pathway in E. coli for the biosynthesis of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), a biodegradable polyester plastic.\n",

Protein presented on the cell surface is fused with part of \u03b2-lactamase protein, while its bait is fused with the complementing part of the enzyme and added to medium. The stronger the interaction between proteins of interest, the more efficient the binding of the two halves of  \u03b2-lactamase, leading to resistance to ampicillin and survival. Cells expressing less interacting variants die as they don't achieve sufficient complementation of the reporter enzyme. This allows us to select strains producing interactors for any given bait.\n",

Using computer modeling, we determined a way to funnel glycolysis\u2019 intermediates towards the production of sorbitol via sorbitol-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Wisconsin\u2019s second aim was to isolate high-energy precursors from the plant cell wall through E. coli mediated breakdown of cell wall lignin. This was achieved by inserting the gene encoding lignin peroxidase , found in the white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium, into genetically modified E. coli, capable of producing and exporting the enzyme. Both projects improve current methods in the production of alternative fuels via two different, unique routes, and have the potential to move sustainable biofuel research forward.\n",

Yet, constraints of limited sequence length and variation recognized by available restriction enzymes pose a major roadblock for synthetic biology.

We use a nucleotide cleavage domain fused to a binding domain, which recognizes a programmable adapter that mediates DNA binding and thus cleavage. As adapter we use readily available modified oligonucleotides, as binding domain anticalins, and as cleavage domain FokI moieties engineered for heterodimerization and activity. For application, this universal enzyme has merely to be mixed with the sequence-specific oligonucleotide and the target DNA. Binding and release are addressed by thermocycling. We provide concepts for in-vivo applications by external adapter delivery and activity regulation by photo switching. Additionally, an argonaute protein is engineered towards a DNA endonuclease.\n",

This biological device encompasses two integrated systems: one for metal accumulation, the other for metal-induced buoyancy. The uptake and storage system consists of a metal transporter and metallothioneins (metal binding proteins). The buoyancy system is made up of a metal-induced promoter upstream of a gas vesicle gene cluster.

To permit bacteria to send an optical signal, we expressed in E. coli a red firefly luciferase under IPTG induction. In yeast, we used a yeast-two-hybrid-system based on the interaction between the red-light-sensitive Arabidopsis thaliana phytochrome PhyB and its interacting factor PIF3. Interaction between PhyB and PIF3 is induced by the red light from the bacteria, resulting in transcription of the lacZ gene. This is an excellent demonstration of the principles and potential of synthetic biology: this system not only allows for interspecies optical communication, but enables us to optically bridge a physically separated canonical lac operon using light as a trans-acting factor.\n",

Promoters are the fundamental elements of every synthetic biological system. We have developed and successfully applied two novel, in silico guided methods for the rational construction of synthetic promoters which respond only to predefined transcription factors. Thus, we have been able to create a library of promoters of different strength and inducibility. To characterize the promoters, we have developed standardized protocols for comparable measurements of promoter strength by either transient or stable transfection. These synthetic promoters can be used as \u201cspybricks\u201d which enable the construction of assays for simultaneously monitoring several pathways in a cell. However, the potential of synthetic promoters goes far beyond this application: e.g. in virotherapy, these promoters could be used for selective gene expression in target cells.\n",

The idea is demonstrated by constructing an odorant sensing module, coupled production of chemical attractant and production of pest-killing binary toxin in yeast to kill pests lured to the yeast culture. A chimera G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) responsive to an odorant chemical is coupled to the yeast mating pathway that can be activated upon ligand binding. \u00a0It leads to over-expression of an endogenous yeast transaminase that catalyzes a reaction to yield 2-phenylethanol. \u00a0Constitutively expressed binary toxin in the yeasts would poison the attracted pests after their consumption, as tested by feeding drosophilae. In addition to being a pesticide substitute, this cheaply-maintained engineered yeast strain also serves as a research reagent to screen for GPCRs that bind to certain ligands.\n",

Can a complex system be divided into independent modules that reside in different cells and interact with each other using nucleotide and protein mediated cell-cell signalling to act as a single unit? We seek to address this problem using a three pronged approach. Firstly, we are trying to introduce natural competance genes into the biobrick framework which will act as nucleotide importers. We are also building a protein export system using the TAT dependent export pathway. Finally, we are attempting to construct a multi-state turing machine which is a compound, modular computational system that has independent, interacting states which applies the above principle. We hope that this approach overcomes the obstacles in building more complex and composite circuits.\n",

Our team comprises of nine undergraduates, 3 graduate students as student mentor and two faculty mentors, one each from biology and engineering background. The project specifically deals with the analysis of effect of single and multiple feedback loops on gene expression. This project will involve theoretical and experimental studies.

With the presence of lactose and arabinose, our Bacterial Decoder will express Green Fluorescent Protein.  If only lactose is present, a different fluorescent protein will be expressed.  This goes for the other two combinations as well (only arabinose, or neither sugars).  To implement logic we use combinations of small non-coding RNAs and transcription factors.

        "abstract": "The issues surrounding energy production are becoming more prominent with increasing environmental concerns and the rising cost of energy.  Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) use biological systems to produce an electrical current.  Cyanobacteria are organisms which have been studied in MFCs and have been found to create a current, although not highly efficient (Tsujimura et al., 2001).  We wish to increase the efficiency of the cyanobacteria MFC by introducing microcompartments to create a BioBattery.  The microcompartments are created by the production of the protein lumazine synthase forms icosahedral capsids.   As a proof of principle we will create this system within Escherichia coli and target two different fluorescent proteins within the microcompartment to observe fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Furthermore, we will be exploring a novel method for the mass production of uniform nanoparticles, which is more efficient and cost effective than current methods.\n",

We investigated a simple representational intercellular signaling network where a population of cells synthesizes and secretes an activator molecule capable of activation a second population of cells into synthesizing and secreting an inhibitor molecular which feeds back and inhibits the production of the activating molecule.  This is known as an activation-inhibition system.  We began by using a partial differential equation model of the system to explore the effect of varying the separation distance of the two populations of cells.  We found that three types of dynamics were present: steady states, periodic oscillations, and quasi-periodic oscillations.  We further designed two strains of E. coli capable of interacting with each other as an activation-inhibition system and endeavored to validate our modeling results in a biological system.\n",

There is concern, however, that these non-native microorganisms may upset the balance of the ecosystem through unnatural competition or horizontal synthetic gene transfer. We are engineering the Toluene Terminator as a way to neutralize toluene pollution while addressing these concerns. It will have the capabilities of sensing and mineralizing the toluene into carbon dioxide and water, but this terminator will not be back.

Our presentation focuses on sophisticated mathematical models of synthetic biological systems that connect the targeted biological phenotype to the DNA sequence. The activities for iGEM 2009 included the development and testing of simulation tools that connect multiple levels of organization from molecules and their interactions, to gene regulatory relations, to emerging logical architectures in bacteria. We connected out tools to the Registry and validated the simulations with a significant experimental component, constructing and testing these synthetic biological systems in Escherichia coli.\n",

Our project involves engineering S. cerevisiae to localize proteins to various points in the cell in response to light exposure. Under red light, a tagged protein of interest localizes to a specific target, while exposure to far-red light causes the protein to rapidly delocalize and diffuse throughout the cell. This is accomplished using the PhyB-PIF3 system, a light-based transcriptional regulation system found in Arabidopsis.  This project has two components. 1) Metabolically engineering yeast to endogenously produce PCB, a tetrapyrrole necessary for system activation, and 2) adapting the PhyB-PIF3 system to localize proteins of interest to different targets in the cell.  The versatility and applications for this system are vast, ranging from cellular diffusion studies to easily synchronizing cell division for entire populations.\n",

Once we have proven that we can produce cinnamaldehyde in E. coli, we will engineer cinnamaldehyde production in duckweed, a small aquatic plant.

        "abstract": "Cadmium contamination can be a serious problem in countries where polluting industries are located close to agricultural sites. Our team developed a design to address this problem using the resiliant spore-forming bacterium Bacillus subtilis. We engineered B. subtilis to sense and sequester cadmium from the environment into metallothionein containing spores, rendering it bio-unavailable. Germination of the spores can be disabled, making retrieval of the cadmium unnecessary since they can persist intact for thousands of years. We computationally simulated the life cycles of individual cells and entire cell populations, to estimate the parameter values necessary to maintain sustainable populations of sporulating, germinating and vegetative cells. Our design required us to engineer  stochastic differentiation processes at a single cell level. A sporulation rate tuner was developed and  we also engineered a tuneable stochastic invertase switch to stochastically control cell differention and fate. \n",

        "abstract": "Sending a message across the ocean\u2026 Outer membrane vesicles (OMV), naturally produced by gram negative bacteria as E. Coli, are strong candidates for long-distance messaging. Our engineered communication platform consists of controlling OMV production by destabilizing membrane integrity through over-expression of specific periplasmic proteins (e.g., TolR). In order to control and modulate message content, we used fusions with OmpA signal sequence and the ClyA hemolysin as delivery tags. A targeting system was developed, based on the outer-membrane expression of Jun/Fos leucine zippers to control the vesicle flux between donor and recipient cells. Once received, the signal from incoming vesicles is transduced through a modified Fec pathway, whereby the receptor is provided by the OMV. Computational models provided insight to all of the above steps. Such reliable communications systems have wide biotechnological implications, ranging from targeted drugs delivery and detoxification to advanced division of labor or even cell-based computing.\n",

Specifically, CD133+ cells have shown resistance to hypoxia, irradiation, and some forms of chemotherapy. CD133+ hunting machines will be created by genetically engineering microglial cells (BV-2) with mammalian expression vectors. The project will also take advantage of inherent qualities of the microglia such as constant environmental sensing and quick motility. The engineered BV-2s will be equipped to locate the specific GBMs and label the targeted cells with a tat-GFP fusion protein. It is the goal of this study to show an alternative approach to cancer treatment, and to emphasize the power of biologically available options to fight the disease.\n",

Currently, treatment for atherosclerosis involves preventative measures and surgical removal of plaque, angioplasty, and stent placement.

Inflamed endothelial cells express VCAM-1, a receptor normally binds to the leukocyte antigen VLA-4. We attempted to express a VLA-4 fragment in E. coli, in order to selectively attach the cells to plaques. In vitro binding test uses inflamed murine endothelial cells which express VCAM-1. Results are pending. Our bacterial chassis also carries several inducible \u201ceffector\u201d systems which, upon binding, release substances that facilitate plaque stabilization and regression. Effector systems include heme oxygenase-1, serum amyloid A and atrial natriuretic peptide. Expression of HO-1 in E. coli has been confirmed using spectroscopy.

This pathway is controlled by a certain wavelength of red light, acting as a system switch for lacZ production. LacZ can react with substrate X-gal and form a blue precipitate as a reporter. However, other reporter genes can be attached to the lacZ gene, so different reporters can be expressed. From the fact that this mechanism is sensitive to a certain wavelength of light, we hope to create a system that can be sensitive to various wavelengths and hence triggering different protein generation. Through this the E.coli can become a wavelength sensor; a different wavelength can trigger a different production of protein, for example various types of fluorescent protein, giving a different a colour-scaled indication of the wavelength of the environment around the E.coli.\n",

Fluorescence patterns for different combinations of conditions are modelled using a new simulation tool designed to be generically applicable to inter-bacterial communication. In the RPS system three 'species' each produce a different fluorescent protein whose expression is downregulated by a lactone from one of the other 'species' and hence the interaction network is intransitive. Simulations indicate that when this game is played out on culture plates, a range of complex patterns evolve with time. Also, selective patterning of the different 'species' allows for new 'racetrack' or 'playing field' type of interactivity.\n",

Our device design consists of two parts: one that modulates deleterious Treg-driven immunosuppression and another that engages Th17-mediated inflammation.  Through specific sensors and effectors, therapy will oscillate between dampening pathologic inflammation and immunosuppression until a balance in the local T cell population is achieved.  Securing such homeostasis between these populations has therapeutic implications for autoimmune disorders like IBD, HIV and cancer.

This type of process exists already, and it is called a vector. It may be biological as viruses, or chemicals as polymeric nanoparticles. Whatsoever its nature, the vector encounters many problems\u00a0: Stability, targeting, membrane passage, and the immune response. Therefore, we tried to achieve the ideal vector, being the most stable as possible, can easily penetrate its targets, and outwit the immune system. We have created a double vectorization system, by using jointly a bacteria and a phage. The first vector which is bacterial, will target the tissue, and resist to the immune system. The second vector is a phage, will be used for cell targeting and\u00a0 membrane penetration.  The combination of the two systems improves the intrinsic abilities of vectors, and offers new possibilities for applications.\n",

Project 2: This project is to design a Yeast Two-hybrid system aimed at Microcystins(MCs) detection in waters. The MCs detection device we design takes the advantage of Gal4 promoter, which consists of two domains, one is AD, the other is BD. When AD and BD are close enough to each other, the report gene transcription LacZ will be trigged. We selected and modified two peptides that have specific interactions with MCs and engineered them into two vectors to construct the Yeast Two-hybrid system. In the presence of MCs at different concentrations, blue dots in different shades of colors can be seen directly. \n",

Today, the Martian environment is severe for any life to inhabit because of some constrained conditions. For instances, the surface temperature having a range from -80\u2103 to 15\u2103, CO2 occupying 95% of the atmosphere and the absence of organic substances on the surface don't allow aerobic organisms or heterotrophic bacteria to grow. Our project objective is to create a genetically engineered iron-oxidizing bacteria surviving on Mars and to establish a new model organism playing an important role to terraform Mars. We engineered Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans by introducing a synthetic pathway of both Melanin and Anti Freeze Protein with temperature-regulated systems. Anti Freeze Protein contributes to enhance tolerance of cryogenic condition and Melanin to blacken the Martian surface eventually resulting in melt of ice cap and generation of atmosphere and sea. \n",

Potential applications range from the production of valuable compounds such as therapeutic molecules and biofuels to the degradation of toxic wastes.  There is increasing recognition that spatial organization can play an important role in optimizing pathway efficiency.  Specifically, the spatial co-localization of consecutive enzymes in a pathway can result in efficient translocation of substrates between enzymes, an effect known as enzyme \"channeling\".  Here we report the design, modeling and construction of a bacterial micro-organelle based system for the targeted co-localization of selected enzymes.  Our \"Encapsulator\" represents a fundamentally new class of parts which, in nature consist of metabolic enzymes encased within a multi-protein shell reminiscent of a viral capsid.  Micro-compartments based on encapsulin (and similar proteins) represent an experimentally amenable system to investigate the effects of channeling in potential downstream applications.\n",

Cell-to-cell communication systems are important because, in most synthetic biology applications, the desired tasks are generally accomplished by a population of cells, rather than by a single cell. The proposed communication system could be used for creating a distributed sensors network, or it could help to better understand and possibly reduce antibiotic resistance in bacteria.

For our biosensor device, reporter constructs were incorporated into the genome downstream of paraoxon and paraoxon-hydrolyis sensitive promoters. Our degradation device was designed in three parts, targeting paraoxon through expression of organophosphate hydrolase from Flavobacterium, sp and two of its degradation byproducts p-nitrophenol and diethyl phosphate. Each device was genomically integrated in order to bypass selective the need for selective condition, while the degradation devices were constitutively expressed for maximum efficiency. Combined, this two-part system allows for both the detection and remediation of a broad range of common and deadly neurotoxins.\n",

For example, can we steer them to migrate toward new signals? Can we make cells move faster? Slower?  We hope to better understand how chemotaxis works, and eventually build cells that can perform useful tasks.

The sequestering of glucose for fibre production by L. plantarum provides the additional benefit of effectively reducing dietary sugars. We have successfully extracted the four genes that code for cellulose synthase from the Acetobacter xylinum. These genes were then placed under the control of a strong constitutive promoter, and transformed into Lactobacillus plantarum. Plasmid and genome based expression of the synthase genes are being evaluated and characterized. In the future, cellulose production assays, evaluation of biofilm formation, and in vivo testing will be performed to determine viability as potential health benefits.\n",

The core of E.ADEM is a self-adaptive controller that can adjust variation rate and selection pressure, based on fitness score, population size and average fitness score calculated by a quorum sensing device.

It is known that for instance neurons, cardiomyocites or muscle cells are able to sense and respond to electrical signals. These cells use a common second messenger system, calcium ion, which promotes a defined response when an electrical pulse is supplied to them. Nevertheless, these cultures present several technical disadvantages in order to make a handily use of them. Valencia team uses this property on yeast to produce luminescence as a response to electrical stimulus. This project constitutes the first time in which the electrical response of Saccharomyces and its potential applications are going to be tested. The obtained results will be used to build the first iLCD in history. We will reflect the perception that different groups of people have about Synthetic Biology in the survey ",

Existing treatment options are too expensive for the majority of affected areas. Therefore we are developing a bioremediation tool using Escherichia coli to absorb and bind arsenic and remove it from its surrounding environment. Natural and synthetic peptides are employed to sequester the toxic ions and a pump knockout ensures that arsenic stays in the cell. Measurement of growth capacity of the engineered strain in arsenic containing media and quantitative analysis of arsenic sequestration will be performed. Characterization and integration of an arsenic-responsive promoter will allow the sequestration system to dynamically adjust to current conditions. A simple, well-implemented system for biosequestration of arsenic may become part of a solution to a problem denying access to clean drinking water for many.\n",

Phototrophs evolved large antennas to compete for photons in natural environments where light is scarce.  Consequently, cells at the surface of photobioreactors over-absorb light, leading to attenuated photobioreactor light penetration and starving cells on the interior of photons. This reduction of photosynthetic productivity has been identified as the primary impediment to improving photobioreactor efficiency.  While reduction of antenna size improves photosynthetic productivity, current approaches to this end uniformly truncate antennas and are difficult to manipulate from the perspective of bioengineering. We aim to create a modifiable system to optimize antenna size throughout the bioreactor by utilizing a synthetic regulatory mechanism that correlates expression of the pucB/A LH2 antenna genes with incident light intensity. This new application of synthetic biology serves to transform the science of antenna reduction into the engineering of antenna optimization.  \n",

Our method uses a novel combination of two systems: secretion and display.  By fusing two tags to the protein it can be secreted into the expression media, and subsequently directed to bind to the outside of the cell.  To collect the pure proteins, cells only need to be spun down and then resuspended in an elution buffer, releasing the protein of interest.

Six pairs of integrase-targeted att sites have been designed to be non-cross-reactive in order to support repeatable cassette-exchange reactions for chromosome building. We have also written software to model the integrase-mediated rearrangement of DNA molecules containing att sites, to aid the design of more elaborate chromosome-building systems. To selectively degrade the native chromosome we designed a nuclease-based, inducible genome-degradation system.

Using cell cytometry (FACS) and fluorimetry, we demonstrated in yeast the successful expression and translational regulation of a fusion of mRNA binding protein and fluorescent protein. These results, along with published parameter values, were used to predict via deterministic and stochastic models that the probability of successful bistability for our switch was 0.96%, but this could be improved theoretically to a maximum of 51.27% by limiting the range of variation of the most sensitive parameters.  The models also predicted that co-operative binding of the mRNA binding protein to its mRNA stem loop was essential for generating switch-like behaviour.  These results suggest that a translationally regulated genetic toggle switch is a viable and novel engineering concept applicable to medicinal, environmental and technological problems.\n",

Democratizing Synthetic Biology will demand fundamental advances to make DNA construction easier and cheaper, thereby enabling broader access to biotechnology by the public. Our team has tackled this challenge with the design of an inexpensive self-contained kit called GENOMIKON, currently targeted for the high school and DIY communities but with clear potential for professional use. The kit contains prefabricated parts that are sequentially assembled on a solid support using cycle times of 5 min./part with a coupling efficiency of ~95%. The parts exist with sufficient diversity and quantity for hundreds of unique experiments. The kit is accompanied by an online resource that serves as lab manual, notebook, information management system and social network for the exchange of ideas. While similar in concept to our last year\u2019s project, GENOMIKON differs in most technical aspects and is far superior in performance.\n",

So, we engineered E. coli to deliver proteins and/or DNA payloads into these bacteria-devouring eukaryotes. Once ingested, our E. coli are programmed to self-lyse and porate the phagosome, releasing their payloads into the cytosol. This delivery mechanism has the potential to deliver payload to any phagocytic organism with a cholesterol-based membrane. As part of our parallel software effort to rework the Clotho plugin environment and API, we made automatic biosafety handling an intrinsic feature of the core. Together, these tools provide a foundation for metazoan synthetic biology and a framework for improving safety in our field.\n",

To eliminate the more clinically relevant Staphylococcus aureus biofilms, our team aims to break new ground at iGEM by using S. aureus as a model host and developing a standard for genetically engineering bacteriophages. Our design incorporates DspB, a biofilm matrix-degrading enzyme into the \u055313 phage genome, which is altered to operate under the regulation of the S. aureus agr quorum sensing pathway and thus upon contact with biofilms.

On an industrial scale, this chemical induction requires large quantities of reagents and extensive purification, while environmental induction requires conditions that can adversely affect cell vitality and yield. To this end, we have designed an E. coli genetic circuit that can pass through four stable states of protein production triggered solely by ON/OFF patterns of light. To efficiently test the components of our circuit, we have also created a system for the transient delivery of transcription factors through the cell and nuclear membranes.

Our work involves characterizing an infrared promoter for light-lysis, experimenting with PHB production in cells, and the design of a dual-wavelength printing system. We discuss how this system could be generalized to create a framework for actuating groups of cells in any 3D volume to theoretically modulate behavior more complex than lysis.

In addition, we have submitted the first lux operon to the registry, taking genes from bacteria which form symbiotic relationships with squid. \u00a0This is the first BioBrick to emit light without addition of substrate and can be used as a reporter with any promoter. These two approaches will allow cheaper assays with brighter signals. \u00a0We also hope they will lay the foundations for natural light sources that help to address the energy crisis facing our planet.\n",

This year, iGEM CHIBA is constructing genetic double-click system whose output is released only when the input (inducing agent) is given twice within a limited time. To discriminate double-click from two separated single-clicks, the 1st input is to be memorized temporarily. If the 2nd input is added before the memory gets lost, output will be produced. If the 2nd input is not added within the given time, the system will be reset to the original state. This mechanism could work as a sort of safety device; by requiring the 2nd \u2018confirmation\u2019 input, one can drastically reduce, or even eliminate, the frequency of false-inputs. This system could be useful in operating the potent or potentially-hazardous biochemical processes.  \n",

Future work will be to develop a tracking system employing a ClyA-fluorescent protein construct for in vitro microscope imaging. An antibody fragment will also be attached to another ClyA complex, allowing the OMV tracking system to target specific regions of an organism.

The BRIDGE protocol (BioBrick Recombineering In Direct Genome Editing) is a protocol for markerless insertion of BioBricks onto the bacterial chromosome, which will bridge ideas and reality in synthetic biology. Bacterial BRIDGEs aim to foster non-chemical means of communication between bacteria by pairing light-producing and light-sensing BioBricks; future teams may make use of them in a variety of novel applications. Finally, human BRIDGEs examine synthetic biology as ways of thinking and the permeation of human aspects, bridging the so-called 'divides' between disciplines and individuals.

        "abstract": "The methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris, is increasingly used as an alternative host for heterologous protein production. P. Pastoris is advantageous because it is able to perform eukaryotic post-translational modifications, produce high yields of recombinant protein, and it is genetically similar to Saccharomyces cerevisiae. (Cereghino and Cregg, 2000). The 2010 Georgia State team believes P. pastoris would be an excellent chassis for the iGEM competition. The purpose of this project is to provide a tool box of parts necessary for the genetic manipulation of this organism. These parts include a variety of promoter systems, multiple selectivity options, and a plasmid backbone. In addition, the tool box will be used to produce a flu virus antigen in P. pastoris as a representation of the applicability of this system. These contributions will enable future users to maximize the use and further explore the incredible potential P. pastoris has to offer.\n",

In the AOX pathway, electrons are transferred from ubiquonone to AOX, and then directly used to reduce oxygen. The drop in the electric potential energy of the electrons transferred from AOX to oxygen is dissipated as heat. Our project has focused on 1) cloning the AOX gene from a thermogenic plant (Sacred Lotus) into E. coli to induce a thermogenic response to a cold-shock, and 2) calculating a theoretical rate of heat production per bacterial colony to select for an appropriate calorimetric technique. Further, numerical methods in MATLAB will be employed to model the steady-state temperature profile of the synthetic bacterial colony, and to potentially corroborate later experimental findings. Engineering a controlled thermogenic response in bacteria could lead to improved bacterial functioning in cold shock environments.\n",

Our idea is to engineer Bacillus subtilis which when applied to a surface,\u00a0automatically forms a hydrophobic biofilm coating.

The result of this process will be a rigid biofilm with\u00a0embedded hydrophobic proteins, leaving a coated surface which is extremely hydrophobic. Producing a self-assembling hydrophobic biofilm is cheap, there is no high-tech treatment involved and there are no hazardous\u00a0chemicals necessary to attain a hydrophobic coating. Applications of this hydrophobic biofilm range from anti-fouling coatings on ships to anti-corrosion coatings used to protect sensory equipment.\n",

The iGEM Team Heidelberg 2010 unlocks the world of synthetic microRNAs, since focusing solely on DNA has often been inconvenient for medical purposes. We engineered a toolkit for standardized measurements of interactions between artificial miRNAs and their binding sites. From this data we were able to compute an in silico model integrating binding site properties and knockdown percentages. Thus, the expression level of any gene of choice could be arbitrarily adjusted by employing the corresponding binding site design. To produce tissue specific miRNA gene shuttles, we developed an evolution-based method for synthesis of new adeno associated viruses. This enabled us to overcome the natural limitations of virus selectivity. In the future, miBricks could be applied for treatment of diseases like Diabetes and Hemophilia, opening the doors to new Synthetic Biology based medical approaches.\n",

To accomplish this, we are constructing chimeric quorum sensing receptors that can localize on Lactobacillus membrane and detect autoinducing peptides (AIPs) released by S. aureus. The ligand binding to the chimeric receptor will trigger downstream plnABCD pathway and initiate the synthesis and secretion of RNAIII inhibiting peptide (RIP), a heptapeptide with proven effectiveness in attenuating S. aureus virulence. The possibility of achieving this lies in the structural homology of the catalytic domain of the quorum sensing receptors in Lactobacillus and S. aureus. Both receptors belong to the HPK10 subfamily of a two-component histidine kinase family. Attenuation of S. aureus virulence by quorum-sensing inhibitors should not yield a strong selective pressure for development of resistance, and would therefore be an attractive concept for preventive medicine.\n",

We plan to use the decreasing pH during curdling and the addition of nicin as the two inputs. To achieve the AND gate we will be using the CRE gene in combination with loxP sites.

Synthetic biology offers great opportunity for biosensors, however current designs require hours before useful output. To tackle this issue in the field, it's crucial that our project can respond in minutes, hence we have engineered a fast, modular sensor framework. This allows detection of a range of different parasites, and may also be used as an environmental tool for mapping their spread. We have developed two new technologies that enable our modular input/output - a novel cell surface biosensor, customisable for specific parasitic proteases, linked through quorum-sensing to a new 'fast-response' module capable of producing a detectable output in minutes. To demonstrate the concept, we've designed and fabricated B. subtilis to give a striking colour readout upon detecting the waterborne Schistosoma parasite which affects 200 million people worldwide.\n",

Past iGEM projects have used chemical or optical stimuli to actuate transcriptional responses. Our project, however, seeks to add voltage sensitivity to Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Baker\u2019s yeast was chosen because in some sense yeast have a system that responds to voltage input. With a voltage stimulus one can open the voltage-gated calcium channels of yeast, causing calcium ions to rush into the cytoplasm. This causes calcineurin to dephosphorylate Crz1, which enters the nucleus and binds various promoters. Our group presents a library of characterized Crz1-sensitive promoters of both naturally-occurring and synthetic varieties. Genes downstream of these promoters are thus voltage-regulated in media containing calcium.\n",

The aryl acylamidase converts a colorless acetaminophen(Tylenol TM) to a brown color substrate. Since the detecting E. coli has three heavy metal promoters, if more than two heavy metals coexist in a solution, the E. coli emit mixed fluorescence, so we simultaneously detect metals. Our goal is to synthetic modules put these three genes for different heavy metals in a row in E. coli and then utilized in the form of a lyophilized powder, which can be stored in a drug capsule to make it portable so that analysis of water is easily processed.

We are targeting catechol for degradation into common metabolic intermediates of the Krebs Cycle by using xylE from Pseudomonas putida that codes for the protein catechol-2,3-dioxygenase.  Catechol-2,3-dioxygenase is being targeted into microcompartments, formed by engineered Aquifex aeolicus protein, lumazine synthase, to reduce cross-talk and increase concentration.  The complex will then be purified and applied to the tailings for catechol degradation.  By funnelling other pathways through catechol we can develop efficient methods for the decontamination of the tailings ponds.  Mms6 from Magnetospirillum magneticum removes heavy metals from solution by forming nanoparticles.

Our first project aims to improve the economics of algal biofuel production by creating a cost efficient microalgae bioflocculant out of\u00a0E. coli. To achieve this, we over-express Type I pili to increase the cell\u2019s adhesiveness, and also express a chlorovirus protein on the cell surface which specifically binds Chlorella species, a promising algal feedstock for the biofuel industry. We are also participating in the Oil Sands Initiative and seeking to improve the biodegradation rate of naphthenic acids (NAs), a toxic by-product of the oil extraction process which can linger in the environment for decades. Two Pseudomonas strains have been found to synergistically degrade 95% of NAs. Our project focuses on engineering these Pseudomonas strains to form biofilms in the harsh tailings water environment, which can potentially increase degradation rates by two orders of magnitude, by expressing a self-associating E. coli protein. \n",

For our project, we will identify and transform the genes encoding proteins responsible for the production and assembly of bacterial microcompartment. Additionally, we will confirm the signal sequences that target enzymes to the protein compartments by fusing this sequence to reporter genes.

These crystal proteins are toxic to certain types of mosquitoes and are not pathogenic to mammals. We designed a temperature-dependent genetic circuit expressing high levels of crystal proteins at room temperature only, thus production does not occur at incubation temperature 37\u00b0C. In order to make an environmentally safe insecticide, our design also incorporates a genetic circuit controlling the population size of E. coli. This intelligent terminator is not limited to mosquitos, as it can be custom fitted with different cry genes to other insect species. Currently, with more than one hundred crystal proteins targeting various insect species, our design may potentially serve as a promising pest control solution in the future. \n",

Repair is effected by production of CaCO3, filamentous cells and Levansucrose. CaCO3 expands at the same rate as concrete, making it the ideal filler. A filamentous cell mesh provides reinforcement. Levansucrose glues CaCO3 and filamentous cells in place. B. subtilis 168 sporulates, making it ideal for storage and transportation. The cells are naturally tolerant to concrete's high pH. We repaired 168's defective swrA and sfp, regaining motility.

        "abstract": "There is considerable interest among bio-industries in bioremediation products such as Rhamnolipids. Rhamnolipids as biosurfactants are important in the remediation of oil spill areas. The cleanup of the Exxon Valdez oil spill using rhamnolipids as biosurfactants was too expensive and complicated, therefore impractical for large-scale bioremediation. However, with advances genetic engineering and synthetic biology offer a viable solution to oil spill pollution clean up. In this project we use genetic engineering as a tool to integrate genetic parts through the BioBrick assembly standard protocol of iGEM to develop a BioBrick for rhamnosiltransferase 1 complex (rhlAB) gene expression in Escherichia coli for standardized rhamnolipid production. Our BioBrick integrates a promoter, a RBS (ribosomal binding site), our part rh1AB gene sequence isolated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a GFP reporter and a terminator. All the parts fit into a plasmid backbone that can be transformed into E. coli strains, which can then produce rhamnolipids.\n",

First of all, we analyzed the function, structure and operation of the transcription factor MerR, a mercury-responsive regulator in detail via bioware experiments and modeling. Then appropriate topology candidates for proper bioreporters were carefully searched. We selected a candidate and re-designed genetic components to accomplish certain bioreporter function in need, which was verified by following bioware experiments. For bioabsorbents, we engineered MerR into a metal binding peptide. This was followed by inductive expression of engineered peptide on surface, periplasm and cytosol of E.coli. This reverse engineering method was then expanded to lead-responsive regulator, PbrR, to confirm the validness of this method. Results demonstrated that the procedure mentioned above is streamlined enough to construct valid whole-cell bioreporters and bioabsorbents of various heavy metals for field application in the near future.\n",

Vibrio cholera was chosen as a test-case, giving us two potential routes to engineer E.coli to recognise the pathogen: 1. Fusion of cholera\u2019s receptor (CqsS) for its quorum sensing molecule (CAI-1) with the internal apparatus of one of E.coli\u2019s general stress detecting systems (BarA). 2.

Our aim is to confer resistance to cholera by taking advantage of quorum-sensing regulated pathogenicity. CAI-1, the cholera autoinducer, is produced by the enzyme, CqsA. E. coli engineered to express CqsA could grow along with regular gut flora and render V. cholerae avirulent by maintaining high CAI-1 concentrations. To lessen its metabolic burden, the system should respond to low concentrations of autoinducer produced by V. cholerae and co-ordinate this response using the Lux quorum-sensing system. We have explored rearranging the network architecture of the Lux system to give bistable expression. A model to describe bistability was formed using ODEs and implemented in C++. To assess the perception of synthetic biology, software was written to gather data from social networking and news sites and quantify the change in opinions with time.\n",

However, many important biological processes are governed by the ratio between the concentrations of multiple chemicals. To create systems capable of responding to more complex input data, the Stanford team designed two types of ratio-measuring sensors. The first sensor utilizes two unique small RNAs to inhibit the transcription of two operons, each responding to an environmental factor and having a specific flourescent protein (or output gene). By manipulating the number of small RNAs produced, a tipping point between outputs can be established for different input ratios. The second sensor uses a phosphorylatable protein to control the transcription rate of an output promoter. By linearly associating two chemical inputs to the production of a kinase and a phosphatase, the ratio of the two environmental factors indirectly dictates the activity of the output promoter.\n",

We have focused on vitiligo in where pigment cells are destroyed, resulting in white patches on the skin. Studies have shown that vitiligo patients have decreased levels of antioxidants and elevated levels of antibodies targeting the pigment cells in the skin. We have used synthetic biology to fuse cell-penetrating peptides to proteins that are deficient in skin of vitiligo patients. The cell-penetrating peptides will aid in passing the proteins through the skin and target the pigment cells to reach repigmentation. Currently there are no treatments like ours for vitiligo patients. However, we strongly believe that synthetic biology can help bacteriotherapy getting a major role in fighting several skin disorders in the future, and that our first explorations in this field inspires others to continue exploring.\n",

Our knowledge of metabolic pathways capable of degrading such contaminants (bioremediation) is limited.  However, the known pathways tend to be slow and inefficient.  The breakdown of many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons generates a common intermediate, catechol that is further degraded to Acetyl-CoA.  Metabolic channeling is an effect whereby intermediates are shuttled between enzymes in a pathway circumventing free diffusion into the cytosol.  Here, we present a design, modeling and baseline experiments aimed at demonstrating optimization of catechol degradation using the principle of metabolic channeling in an E. coli proof of concept system.\n",

Therefore, our Antibody Production System would be composed of two devices: Module I: Generation of antibody library; Module II: Selection of specific antibodies.\n",

By developing a computational biological network based on RNA logical devices we will offer everyone the opportunity to 'program' their own cells with individual AND/OR/NOT connections between BioBricks of their choice. Thereby, BioBricks can finally fulfill their original assignment as biological parts that can be connected in many different ways. We will achieve this by engineering simple and easy-to-handle switches based on predictable RNA/RNA-interactions regulating transcriptional termination. These switches represent a complete set of logical functions and are capable of forming arbitrarily complex networks.\n",

The UCL iGEM team aims to create \u201cindependent\u201d cells in which the production phase is triggered by an external stimulus, removing the need for IPTG. \u00a0The stationary phase growth in bioreactors is preceded by a dip in dissolved oxygen tension (DOT) followed by a DOT spike. We have developed a genetic circuit in which a series of promoters will cause the production to be triggered by the hypoxic condition. This auto-induction promises an economically and manufacturing improved production of biopharmaceuticals.

Our project develops a system to engineer the genome of the photosynthetic cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, establishes expression standards for this species, and adds a set of characterized Synechocystis promoters and ribosome binding sites to the BioBrick toolbox. We developed a BioBrick vector that can be used to assemble parts and devices in E. coli. Upon transformation into Synechocystis, it integrates the device directly into the genome through homologous recombination. We utilized genes that were activated under a variety of conditions, from those responding to heat stress to ones oscillating under a circadian rhythm. The promoters and ribosome binding sites were converted into BioBrick-compatible parts, and subsequently characterized. Our success will enable the use of existing parts in new species, and will expand the range of devices that can be built.\n",

But, once the temperature reaches its optimum on the planetary surface the color production should be switched off. In order to achieve that and taking advantage of Synthetic Biology principles, a switch based on prion proteins (on mad yeast!) will be used. The work will be complemented with the implementation of the expression of\u00a0 LEA (late embryogenesis abundant) \u201cantifreeze\u201d protein.

The use of quorum sensing can help transform an inherently analog molecular signal into a binary response and simultaneously allow the tuning of input response thresholds and signal amplification.  This project demonstrates these capabilities through experimentation and modeling.  Another candidate for reapplying an electronic engineering technique is the codesign of hardware and software to implement a function.   In synthetic biology, codesign might mean implementing a design spec in different expression control regimes and comparing their relative merits.  Our work examines the codesign concept by constructing an AND gate in three different design domains.  We explore the application of these ideas with an environmental sensor.  A unique aspect of our project is the collaborative nature involving five institutions at three locations.\n",

Invasin causes uptake of the bacterium into the mammalian cell by induction of endocytosis. Bacterial cells are lysed in the endosome and then LLO is released. LLO is a pore-forming toxin which causes endosomal membrane disruption and release of the payload (either protein or DNA) into cytoplasm of the mammalian cell. In order to fine-tune expression of genes used in our project we conducted measurement of various RBS parts included in 2010 spring distribution both from Community and Anderson's collections. We used standard measurement kit composed of promoter BBa_J23100 and GFP+terminator part BBa_I130401. We performed both relative and absolute RBS strength measurement.\n",

Our first project targets Bacillus anthracis, the Gram-positive pathogen that causes anthrax.  We re-engineered an enzyme to remove the pathogen's protective coating, rendering it defenseless against the immune system.  In our second project, we re-engineered and transplanted a protein secretion system capable of combating Gram-negative bacteria into E. coli.  This system was designed to target Gram-negative pathogens in a modular and controllable fashion.  These two systems are the vanguard of a new era of antibiotics using the power of nature harnessed with the tools of synthetic biology.\n",

A mutually exclusive exon splicing system was formulated in which Sex-lethal interacts with the native splicing machinery to affect splice site choice. Two vectors have been designed to facilitate simple bacterial BioBrick manipulation and subsequent chromosomal integration into the yeast genome.

We are engineering Neurospora crassa, a highly efficient cellulose metabolizer, to produce an excess of fatty acids by both inhibiting beta oxidation and up-regulating fatty acid synthesis by the one-step replacement of the FadD gene with a thioesterase gene. We are testing the growth of Neurospora on a variety of waste substances and are developing an efficient chemical esterification method to convert the fatty acids into fatty acid methyl esters, a common biodiesel requiring no changes to current fuel delivery infrastructure.  Neurospora crassa's broad substrate preferences give it unique advantages for bioproduction from cellulose. We have therefore developed an efficient and reliable system for modular bioengineering of Neurospora including a starter kit of basic reusable parts with the intent of creating a novel chassis for metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.\n",

By replacing the periplasmic domain of ToxR with existing or engineered ligand-dependent homodimers, we hope to link ToxR dimerization (and gene expression) to the presence of specific ligands. Initially, ToxR constructs proved to be toxic to E. coli. To address ToxR toxicity, we screened microarray data for promoters that exhibited stress-based down regulation. We constructed a negative feedback system with the rffGH promoter, which permits the use of potentially toxic proteins like our various ToxR chimeras. By fusing existing or engineered ligand dependent homodimers to ToxR, this modular system can be applied to develop new biosensors. \n",

Our goal is to create a system housed in E. coli that can be used to process water and remove endocrine disruptors on a large scale. We focus on isolating degradation systems for the common endocrine disruptors bisphenol A (BPA), DDT, nonylphenol and estradiol.  We synthesized known degradation enzymes DDT dehydrochlorinase, BisdA and BisdB, and characterized the behavior of these enzymes when acting on our target endocrine disruptors. In addition, we explored the potential of certain cytochrome p450s to initiate degradation of these chemicals, focusing on WT-F87A degradation of BPA. Finally, we characterized the functionality of E. coli protein processing when E. coli is deployed as an easily containable biofilm on various substances in aqueous environments.\n",

The surface bonding is performed by the well characterized biotin-avidin mechanism. When combined in series, these chips operate as a linear biochemical pathway for continous flow reactions. Additionally, we engineered E. Coli with the mechanism for light-induced apoptosis to easily lyse cultures producing the necessary enzymes. The resulting lysate is flowed through the microfluidic channels, coating them with the desired enzyme.

The controller interface is made with emphasis on interoperability and applications in mind. Specifically, we use zinc finger repressors and degradation tags to reduce cross-talk and make the network more robust.

We created a toolbox of biobrick parts that enable this system to secrete any protein of interest when fused to the C-terminal secretion signal of RsaA. Because Caulobacter is cheap and easy to grow but cannot survive in a human host, it has the potential to be an efficient chassis for enzyme-based drug delivery. As a proof-of-concept, we engineered non-biofilm forming strains of Caulobacter to secrete two enzymes, Esp and DspB, which have been shown to degrade biofilms.

Our group has developed a foundational technology for synthesizing nearly 50,000 unique ZFPs using chip-based DNA synthesis based on bioinformatic analysis and for identifying the best binder using a novel genomically encoded 1-hybrid genetic selection scheme in a massively multiplexed fashion. Further, we employed multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) for facile editing of the E. coli genome enabling rapid modification of ZFP target sites, gene knockouts and silent codon substitutions. These tools allow for low-cost creation of ZFPs targeting any endogenous human gene, which will increase the accessibility of customized genome editing for gene therapy.\n",

A novel mechanism based on an E.coli chassis, was designed with two main objectives:  to sense arabinose reporting its concentration and to use light receptors to trigger the expression of the required pathways. The first receptor enables E.coli to activate (express), the arabinose sensing mechanism; whereas the second receptor activates a quick deactivation(degradation), of the sensing mechanism depriving the cell of that capability.\n",

To ameliorate worldwide malnutrition, we engineered baker\u2019s yeast to produce vitamins A and C. \u201cVitaYeast\u201d can be used to bake bread without special equipment, training, orreagents. We designed our genetic constructs using state-of-the-art optimization techniques, simulations, and data from our parts characterization experiments. In order to realize this design, we developed an extensive yeast toolkit including promoters, UTRs, and vectors. We synthesized the violacein pathway, which, combined with our vitamins and intermediate metabolites, represent a new set of yeast reporters. Finally, to assess the potential of VitaYeast to combat hunger in the real world, we have sought IRB approval to distribute an extensive survey on attitudes toward genetic engineering of food world-wide.\n",

Tailings ponds are artificial reservoirs where the by-products such as toxic organic compounds, heavy metals or fine clay particles are stored until they are remediated by industrial treatment or natural degradation, which can require decades.  We are developing the components necessary to create a tailings pond clean up kit for removal of harmful by-products.  The first component uses the xylene degradation pathway of Pseudomonas putida optimized by the use of a protein microcompartment produced from the engineered Aquifex aeolicus protein lumazine synthase.  The second component  removes heavy metals by producing nanoparticles with the Magnetospirillum magneticum protein Mms6.  The third component causes sedimentation of fine clay particles using natural properties of Eschericia coli and cell aggregation with Antigen 43.  The final component removes the genetically modified organism\u2019s DNA by using restriction endonucleases.\n",

As a result, glucose accumulates to dangerous levels. High blood glucose concentrations can cause irreversible damage to critical organs, impairing their functionality. With parts from the iGEM registry, our team created a glucose-controlled promoter linked to a yellow fluorescence production gene in E. coli. The concentrations of glucose to which the promoter responds can be determined. Once the concentration is known, the promoter can be mutated so that it will be activated by varying concentrations of glucose and be used as a glucose sensor for people with diabetes. In the future, an insulin gene could be added to this system for use in insulin pumps, where specific glucose levels trigger insulin production in E. coli.\n",

Fortunately, nature has provided us with robust, cellular systems capable of governing the autonomous formation of complex structures. To pursue control of multicellular systems, we engineered a number of ligand-receptor signaling mechanisms: the Notch-Delta juxtacrine signaling pathway and an assortment of G-Protein Coupled Receptors. Both signaling systems were modified to activate orthogonal genetic circuits, allowing for processing and integration of numerous signals. In order to facilitate and maintain pattern formation, we introduced cadherin, a natural intercellular glue. To understand and predict multicellular behavior, we developed a simulation framework based on the Synthetic Biology Open Language and CompuCell 3D modeling environment. Our models motivated several circuit designs we subsequently tested in the laboratory. Altogether, our developments establish a paradigm for manipulation of intercellular communication systems to drive self-organization of tissues.\n",

The problems are reduction in land available for food production, relatively low levels of CO2 biofixation, and large biomass requirements. Our project aims to overcome these problems by utilizing E. coli for the production of biodiesel (C-12 fatty acids) and bioethanol. There have been a number of examples of biofuel production in E. coli; however 30-40% of production cost is based on media costs. Our project will surmount these high production costs by engineering the cyanobacteria, Synechocystis PCC6803, to secrete large quantities of glucose that will feed our biofuel-producing E .coli. Cyanobacteria and E.coli will be co-cultivated to allow the mutual transfer of carbon to produce biofuels.  This project provides an efficient means for producing biofuels without a carbon source.  It will also create a novel cooperative system between bacterial species that may have further industrial implications.\n",

In addition to being the primary cause of lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients, many severe nosocomial infections can be attributed to P. aeruginosa. Currently, the standard detection method requires a potential sample to be grown overnight and then screened for the pathogen of interest. Our goal is to create a faster detection method without sacrificing reliability or experimental resolution. To realize our objective, we harnessed the native cell signaling and quorum sensing machinery of P. aeruginosa.  Quorum sensing in P. aeruginosa is a complex hierarchy that governs the expression of numerous virulence genes. Quorum sensing elements from P. aeruginosa were transplanted into E. coli and used to express detectable reporters. We are thus creating a novel biosensor capable of detecting the presence of P. Aeruginosa both quickly and effectively.\n",

Rhamnolipids have emulsifying properties that reduces the surface tension of water, making the hydrocarbons easier to recover and biodegrade. This year we want to create a BioBrick that provides rhamnose for rhamnolipid biosynthesis and for other purposes as well. We also want to create a bioremediation system using existing biobricks that will produce the rhamnolipid while biodegrading the hydrocarbons in vivo. The system will be designed to operate with a lysis gene that will kill the cells once bioremediation of the contamination site is done.\n",

Such signaling is limited by diffusion coefficients and unique cell properties, and cannot easily be controlled in therapeutic applications. The goal of this project was to demonstrate light-based cell signaling in mammalian cells. Using luminescent proteins and optogenetic tools, we constructed \u201cSender\u201d and \u201cReceiver\u201d HEK 293T cells which send and receive blue light, respectively. The Sender Cell expresses a 480nm light emitting protein. The Receiver Cell expresses Channelrhodopsin-2, an ion channel gated by 480nm light. When the Receiver Cell is illuminated, Channelrhodopsin-2 opens, triggering a second luminescent protein via calcium influx. Since the luciferases in this system require an externally added luciferin substrate, we have also been developing Pre-coelenterazine, a genetically encoded luciferin which could allow our system to function autonomously. Our light signaling system has eventual applications in interkingdom signaling and optical controlling of synthetic networks.\n",

We are working to create a robust and reliable biosensor that utilizes the lambda phage lytic-lysogenic switch as the radiation sensor. When the sensor detects radiation, it triggers one of three fast acting reporters we developed based on the concept developed by Imperial College\u2019s 2010 iGEM team. Each of the reporters features a different enzyme/substrate reaction (\u03b2-galactosodise/\u03b2-D-galactose, \u03b2-glucurodinase/\u03b2-D-glucuronide or C23O/catechol).

Mms6 is a critical catalytic protein which binds to magnetite in order to facilitate the formation of an uniform crystal structure. Using the Mms6 gene from Magnetospirillium Magneticum AMB-1 we intend to create a magnetite synthesis pathway in E.Coli.  Finally as a proof of concept, we will also show how we can use the formation of magnetite as a novel gene expression system. We intend to achieve this through the use a ToxR - Mms6 fusion protein and the ctx promoter from Vibrio cholerae. This novel gene expression system can be used to help bridge the gap between biological and digital systems.\n",

Since nowadays we are exposed to continuously stress, perhaps we can avoid the negative effects caused by this condition. Thus, a mechanism that counteracts this imbalance is highly desirable. The ability of some bacteria to sense stress hormones such as Catecholamines will be used to produce Interleukin-12 and inducing Th1 lineage. On the other hand, the ability to sense Nitric-Oxide released in inflammatory conditions will be used to trigger Interleukin-10 production, counteracting excessive immunity.

Plasmids contain unique DNA sequences that can be targeted by the CRISPR system. We exploited this system by engineering E.coli with an inducible mechanism of self-curing plasmid based antibiotic resistance.  We synthesized a version of CRISPR encoding a spacer that matches the GFP DNA sequence. We tested the synthetic CRISPR array against E.coli harboring a tetO::GFP plasmid that confers ampicillin resistance.  Activation ofCRISPER-gfp destroys the gfp-containing plasmid restoring the bacterial host's sensitivity to ampicillin.

In order to optimize expression levels of various gene products, we constructed a dual luciferase expression measurement device. We used this device to provide more detailed characterization of promoters and ribosome binding sites from E. coli and Synechocystis. We also produced a variety of useful intermediate parts for the dual luciferase device, which are currently not available through the registry, allowing this measurement system to be easily adapted to new organisms and new reference standards.\n",

We have devised a circuit to be incorporated in a yeast chassis that efficiently expresses two vital angiogenic proteins--vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF-B)--in a sequential and time-dependent manner that approximates the natural cascade of growth factor release in the human body.

The WashU team created four DNA constructs for homologous recombination into the S. cerevisiae genome that will catalyze the production of \u03b2-carotene. Each construct consisted of a gene encoding an enzyme from Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous, a bacterium that produces \u03b2-carotene. Three of the constructs encode for enzymes in the metabolic pathway required for \u03b2-carotene production, while a fourth enzyme cleaves \u03b2-carotene to form \u03b2-ionone, a rose-scented compound used in the fragrance industry. Additionally, the WashU team has established spectraphotometric assays to detect \u03b2-carotene and \u03b2-ionone in yeast extract.

However, these biosensors did not produce the low uninduced and high induced levels of expression desired. This situation appears to be common among biosensor-based iGEM projects. In order to improve the biofuel sensors, as well as provide a framework for other teams to do the same, a universal biosensor directed evolution construct was assembled. The device can be used to both select for high expression in the presence of an analyte, as well as select for no expression in its absence. In conjunction with mutagenesis of key genes, this device could be used to significantly improve existing and novel biosensors. \n",

The purpose of this study was to express, purify, and characterize a novel, hyperactive antifreeze protein recently isolated from the Siberian beetle, Rhagium inquisitor (RiAFP). Large scale (150mg/L), stable production of RiAFP and a RiAFP-GFP fusion protein was achieved in E. coli. Proteins were purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. E. coli expressing RiAFP exhibited increased survival post-freezing. RiAFP inhibited ice recrystallization in both splat and capillary assay. To optimize the activity of the hypothesized RiAFP ice binding site, we are using directed evolution through multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE). Finally, we are further optimizinge our crystallization conditions for RiAFP to better understand the structure-function relationship, as well as conducting post-freezing survival assays in C. elegans.\n",

These investigations of soil lead us to ask questions about citizen\u2019s science \"performed\" by non-institutional actors using accessible tools as well as gives us a glimpse into the \"post-natural world\" where BioBricks may end up in our environment and may very well show up as bands in a gel.

With the development of the dairy industry in China, yogurt has become highly accepted by consumers, including those lactose intolerance people. And postacidification has always been the most vital factor which affects the shelf life and flavor of yogurt. So our team takes it as our track. Through the literature, we have discovered a gene, called lacR, which could combine with the lactose operon to inhibit the production of lactic acid in Bulgaria Lactobacillus. If lacR could be highly transcripted in Bulgaria Lactobacillus when the pH value of yogurt declines to a certain level, the acidification of yogurt would be postponed. Meanwhile, we also want to transfer part of human collagen genes to Streptococcus Thermophilus in order to enhance the nutrition of yogurt.\n",

Here we use a synthetic biology approach to imitate heterochromatin in E.coli to achieve gene silencing. Specifically, fusion proteins comprising tetR and different parts of HNS (histone-like nucleoid structuring protein) were synthesized, they are expected to bind DNA specifically and carry out polymerization among the fusion HNS and the native HNS to create a densely packed DNA form, which may block the transcription. We produced constructs with tetO sites upstream or downstream of lac promoter and EGFP gene. Then we used standard constitutive promoters with different activity to drive our fusion proteins to find the optimum expression level. Moreover, tetR, HNS and fusion proteins were purified and gel shift assay was utilized to detect the interaction between those proteins with DNA. This study presents a novel approach to introduce a mimic heterochromatin-like structure into prokaryotes to achieve inducible gene silencing. \n",

Our team has engineered disruptor /E. coli/ expressing mutated toluene-4-monooxygenase, which facilitates indole degradation. Introducing this disruptor strain into an /E. coli/ culture of HR and LR individuals is thus hypothesized to result in massive LR cell death at a lower-than-expected antibiotic concentration. If successful, indole degradation may become a possible strategy in boosting antibiotics effectiveness in medical practices against bacteria relying on similar signalling methods. We are also constructing a novel strain of /E. coli/ that utilizes an essential gene (/nadE/) for antibiotic-free transformation and plasmid maintenance. This strain can help future iGEM teams reduce their antibiotics consumption without deviating significantly from widely used transformation protocols. \n",

We have designed a cloning vector containing a Proteorhodopsin generator which confers a survival advantage to transformants in nutrient limiting conditions. And thus, we propose a novel screening technique that uses metabolic stress to screen for transformants in the presence of light. In addition, using the stress alleviation due to proteorhodopsin activity, we intend to enhance the yield of recombinant proteins and substrate consumption efficiency.\n",

Brush E. coli possesses genes (lasI, luxI, rhlI, and cinI) in its gDNA that produce quorum molecules. On the other hand, by modified Cre-loxP mechanism, gDNA is randomly set to secrete only one of the four types of quorum molecules. Paint E.coli possesses plasmids that express one of four colors (red, cyan, yellow, and green) by producing fluorescent proteins in response to the type of quorum it receives from Brush E.coli. As Paint E.coli expresses corresponding fluorescence in response, it also produces quorum molecule that is identical to the inducer to start propagation. Ultimately, using this system, the \u201crandom\u201d contribution of cells will create art on an LB plate.\n",

We insert human leukemia genes into Drosophila genome and also fuse a green fluorescent protein(GFP) with a leukemic protein to monitor its expression in E. coli or Drosophila.

Each generating different protein expression levels in order to test performance in reliability and consistency, but this process is both tedious and time consuming. To overcome this problem, our team provided a novel circuit design method_ Pathway Commander. We construct a single version of a synthetic metabolic pathway circuit that can use culture temperature shifts to control the expression levels of a series of metabolic proteins at the precise times. We have implemented the Pathway_Commander design in (1) Carotenoid synthesis Pathway, (2) Violacein biosynthesis pathways and (3) Butanol synthesis pathway in E. coli. This circuit design utilizes a temperature controlled system that gives precision control over metabolic protein expression which amounts to optimal synthesis that can maximize synthesis of a given compound or drug. \n",

However, to achieve neuronal network stimulation, light cables are still needed, leaving long-standing annoying issues regarding immune responses unresolved. This year NYMU-Taipei iGEM team creates wireless neuro-stimulator, focusing on achieving remote neuro-stimulation to minimize the invasion and damage to the neuron. To achieve this goal, we use a species of magnetic bacteria, Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1. We have chosen mms13, a transmembrane protein as our target for protein design, as it serves as a linker between reception of wireless magnetic field and optogenetic neuro-stimulation output. Regarding the neuroimmune response, we choose three genes to achieve symbiosis within glial cell: MinC, a division inhibitor, INV, a gene for invasion and LLO, a gene for facilitated escape from phagosomes. Overall, our project will make optogenetic neuro-stimulation wireless and safe.\n",

The need for low-cost, portable and easy-to-use dosimeters became apparent as radiation measurements could only be conducted at sparsely-distributed installations and the values reported infrequently. We have decided to tackle the issue by building a biological dosimeter. Focus is placed on modularly transferring radiation response and DNA repair genes from the extremophilic bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans to the well-characterized, easily cultivable chassis Escherichia coli. The native DNA damage detection and repair systems of E. coli will be also modified to efficiently sense ionizing radiation through detection of the resultant DNA damage. Finally, detection will be connected to visible outputs such as color pigment production, resulting in a biological device capable of detecting ionizing radiation and alerting users to it through color change. \n",

This theory explains the composition and phenomena of the physical universe. In the system there exists close relationships classified as mutual promoting and restraining under certain conditions, by which functions of the various systems are coordinated and homeostasis of universe maintained. In our project, five modified nutritionally deficient bacteria represent the five elements in the theory. They talk to each other emitting and receiving specific signals called AHLs. Five pairs of signal receivers and producers, like luxR and luxI, are involved in achieving the process. Moreover, one will help another producing the essential nutrition for living while limit the production of a third member. Through such mechanism, the whole group survive and live in moderate coexistence, just like the effect of the philosophical theory.\n",

Inhibitors strongly affect the normal physiology of yeast as well as its ethanol productivity, just like the dementors taking away people\u2019s hope and happiness. Nevertheless, we reconstruct TOR protein, a central component of major signaling transduction network controlling cell growth, to increase the tolerance of yeast.

Getting close to pathogens, it sends the killer gene to them with conjugation. Then pathogens will be killed. To accomplish this project, we planned to add three functions to E.coli. First, expression of the mutant H-NS proteins enables E.coli to move faster. This contributes to increasing the frequency of conjugation. Second function is new taxis for AHL. We make the target bacteria as a model of pathogens, and they produce AHL. BeE.coli goes for the area where high concentrations of AHL that means concentration of target bacteria. Last, BeE.coli kills pathogens by sending the killer gene with the conjugative plasmid. BeE.coli has the anti killer gene repressing the killer gene. In the future, BeE.coli will be useful for medical scenes.\n",

A bacterial micro-compartment (BMC) was engineered into our E. coli micromachine to act as a tank to accumulate heavy metals. Heavy metal ions, such as Zn2+, Cd2+, and As2+, that are taken up by the cell will be trapped inside the tank by a metallothionein fused to a BMC-localizing tag. Using BMC in such a way will be very advantageous as it may achieve the accumulation of high concentrations of heavy metals in one place. The EcoLion that has stored heavy metals will be conveniently collected by light using phototaxis or self-aggregation. This EcoLion may ultimately be applied for collecting a number of different toxic or valuable molecules by using specific target-binding peptides or proteins.\n",

E.coli populations communicate bi-directionally by a class of signaling molecules involves in bacteria quorum sensing, that is, N-Acyl homoserine lactones (AHL), to regulate the gene expression of each other. By engineering their gene circuits, two groups (we call them CELL-A and CELL-B) will form a network, with B inducing A and A restricting B, thus cycle in a homochronous way. We have established a mechanism to change the rate of the AHL expression, allowing us to control the period and the phase of the oscillatory cycle. Moreover, a mathematical model has been made to analyze the dynamics of the system, and computer simulation software is introduced into the process.\n",

Together these genes used UDP-glucose as substrate and synthesize. We aim to clone acs operon and transform it into environmental friendly and economical microbes in order to produce large amount of cellulose for paper industry. In doing so we minimized global deforestation as well as CO2 emission.

However, release of these microbes to the open environment would pose increasing threat to the society due to the possibility of changes expected in the indigenous microbial population. Hence, we have engineered a synthetic self-killing system for the famous industrial workhorse, Escherichia coli. High temperature (370C), native quorum sensing molecule (AI-2) and the darkness present in the fermentor will keep the self-killing system turned off. Environmental signals such as low temperature (25 0C), foreign quorum sensing molecules and light encountered by the E. coli outside of the fermentor would trigger the self-killing device. Unlike other lysis device, we have introduced a novel self-killing device that chops up the DNA. Thus, this system would not only favor cell death but also ensure that all the genetic materials are destroyed and guarantee that there would be no horizontal gene transfer.\n",

Current parts in the Registry designed to regulate periodic oscillations of gene expression have shown limited success. Here we demonstrate a biological clock being standardised as a set of BioBrick parts. Our network is controlled by an engineered promoter, Plac/ara, which features both an activator and a repressor domain. This controls the production of downstream genes to activate other inducible promoters, pBAD and GlnAp2, eventually leading to the production of a repressor protein, lacI, which inhibits Plac/ara, resulting in oscillatory expression. This project shows the feasibility of standardising the biological clock in E. coli and grounds further development for applications in regulated drug/hormone delivery and ion channel control.\n",

However, these devices have often been limited by the requirement of a high cell density at the target site in order to achieve higher efficiencies. To overcome this, we devise an inducible self- assembling system in Escherichia coli utilizing L-aspartate (L-Asp) chemotaxis. Our system consists of two cell types: \u201cguiders\u201d and \u201cworkers\u201d. When exposed to a signal, the former discharge and generate a signal-centered spatial L-Asp gradient, and the latter lose motility by repression of a flagellum-regulating gene (cheZ). These cells remain at the source of the signal and cannot escape. Using E. coli-derived stress-sensitive promoters cloned de novo, we provide evidence that our system enables auto-assembly and localization after exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Since the input can be varied to other inducible promoters, we anticipate that our system to greatly enhance the potential of engineered cellular machineries.\n",

The cell density is influenced by the expression levels of a killer gene (ccdB) in our device. We have successfully controlled the expression levels of ccdB by site-directed mutagenesis of a luxR promoter (lux pR) and error-prone PCR of gene luxR, and we are building a database for a series of mutation sites corresponding to different cell densities and fluorescent intensities.

Some Nematode NHRs can be activated by extracted oil contamination of the soil so they can use as possible oil sensors in the future. Zinc finger motifs are the tools of NHRs to bind DNA and regulate gene expression directly. These tiny elements can be tested as direct gene regulators. Controlled gene induction can also lead to programmed cell death which is a less harmful tool in order to quit non-functionable cells.\n",

One such application could be the optimization and fine-tuning of synthetic biological circuits, which is currently a cumbersome process of trial and error. We have investigated a novel type of RNA regulation, where the inhibition caused by a small regulatory RNA is relieved by another RNA called trap-RNA. The system displays a large dynamic range and can uniquely target and repress any gene of interest providing unprecedented flexibility. We suspect that any level of repression is achievable by simply altering the sequences of the involved RNAs. Multiple such systems can coexist without interfering and are thus compatible with more complex designs. Furthermore the trap-RNA can be fused to any transcript in effect allowing any gene to act as an activator.\n",

A synthetic operon was constructed, based on the pduABJKNTU genes from Salmonella, that assembled into the empty Sphereactor, which was also affinity-tagged to allow its isolation for downstream applications. A new targeting sequence comprising 20 residues of PduD was shown to target GFP into The Sphereactor. Attempts were made to pack the Sphereactor with many other proteins. Together, the Sphereactor and its new targeting sequence is a foundational advance that could influence the design of new metabolic pathways or inspire new bioremediation or biomedical projects.\n",

We investigate two methods of bringing the enzymes close together: cell surface display via Ice Nucleation Protein, and phage display via M13's major coat protein. We attempt a new DNA assembly protocol, provisionally named \"BioSandwich\". We construct computer models of synergy.

The SmoColi cells are immobilized in an agarose-filled microfluidic device. The test solution is fed on one end of a microfluidic channel, in which an acetaldehyde gradient is established by synthetic cellular degradation. The cells are engineered to sense acetaldehyde by a synthetically re-designed fungal acetaldehyde-responsive transactivator. The sensor is linked to a band-pass filter that drives GFP expression. This allows establishment of an input-concentration-dependent, spatially located fluorescent band displaying quantitative information about acetaldehyde.

The main aims of our project can be separated into three light-controlled components: the designed sculpting of biofilms; 3D printing for encapsulation of cells; and the controlled modular synthesis of a variety of products. We expect this technology to have applications for material synthesis and compound manufacture in remote locations, for example outer space.\n",

Our system is based on a comparison between an unknown mercury concentration and a known IPTG concentration. A linear IPTG gradient is present on a test-strip containing the engineered bacteria. When the mercury solution is added, the regulatory network will switch to one of two states depending on the IPTG/mercury ratio. Bacteria become either\u201csender\u201d or \u201creceiver\u201d. The bacteria sensing a predominance of mercury over IPTG, the \u201csenders\u201d, will release a quorum sensing molecule which is detected by the nearby \u201creceivers\u201d. The reception of quorum sensing molecules will induce the expression of a red dye in the \u201creceivers\u201d. In this way, a red line emerges at a position in the IPTG gradient from which the unknown mercury concentration can be deduced.\n",

We  achieved this by utilization of auto-inducing loops, that act as memory units, and an engineered riboregulator, acting as an AND gate. The design of the device is modular, allowing free change of both input and output signals. Each increase of the counter results in a different output signal. The design allows implementation of any number of memory units, as the AND gate design enables to extend the system in a hassle-free way. \nIn order to tweak bistable autoinducing loops we need a very fast and robust method for characterizing parts. For this we have created a genetic algorithm that will enable us to find parameters of the parts used in the design. It also allows the combination of data from multiple experiments across models with overlapping components.\n",

Firedamp is a flammable gas found in coal mines and it mainly contains methane. Beside its explosive property, methane is also the main contributor to global warming. However, recent mechanisms in mines release the methane that is collected into air. By offers of Synthetic biology, we aimed to design a device which will work on E.coli that provides solutions for side effects of methane. Device that we are planning to construct involves the genes of bacteria (Methylococcus capsulatus) and insect (Drosophilia melanogaster) Our compact system in E.coli is fabricated as sensation of methane, the conversion of methane to methanol and then entrapment of methanol to handle for biofuel and death of bacteria at 42 C by kill switch mechanism.\n",

We set to provide new evidence for this cell-to-cell communication and to allow the synthetic biology community to harness its potential for amorphous computing and metabolic engineering. We developed and characterized new B.subtilis BioBricks designed to validate this finding by testing a wide range of molecules that could potentially travel through the nanotubes and be detected via signal amplification. We worked on molecules of different size and nature to best characterize the transfer. Modeling suggests that we will be able to follow the diffusion through the nanotube network by fluorescence microscopy. TuBe or not TuBe? Our ongoing experiments will shed light on this elusive question. \n",

Towards this goal, we mutate and select microviridins, which are tricyclic depsipeptides from cyanobacteria. They are small but stable due to their post-translational side-chain crosslinking. Microviridins have a high potential for therapy as they can block disease-relevant proteases. Yet, the possibilities of cyclic peptides are largely untapped since genetic systems for optimization are not well established. Thus, we developed synthetic systems for the mutation, selection and production of such peptides. We use the 6.5 kb microviridin (mdn) gene cluster cloned in E. coli plasmids, established random mutagenesis and generated focused libraries of microviridins. For selection against a panel of proteases, we are applying and testing phage display, and we are constructing a novel in-vivo selection device, which links protease blocking to antibiotic resistance. Our systems, including the 6.5 kb cluster, adhere to the BioBrick standards.\n",

However, plants are a major focus of synthetic biology due to their potential use in an array of applications from food security to synthesis of biofuels. The short time scale of the iGEM competition has often meant that plant based projects are challenging and there have been very few in previous years. As the first iGEM team at UEA and in co-operation with the JIC, we felt that we could make a significant contribution to plant based synthetic biology. The overall aim of our project is to help develop and where possible pioneer some of the fundamental technologies and methodologies needed to make plant based synthetic biology projects possible. To achieve this we hope to adapt existing synthetic biology approaches which are successful in Escherichia coli for use in plants.\n",

As a proof of concept, we designed a simple genetic controller that regulates the concentration of 3OC6-HSL signalling molecule around  a user-defined set-point. The controlled variable (3OC6-HSL) increases as a function of the exogenous anhydroTetracycline input, that triggers LuxI expression. The controller senses the 3OC6-HSL concentration and activates the production of AiiA, that degrades it.\nTo observe the desired behaviour, a fine tuning of the system was necessary.  The transcriptional/translational strength of the regulatory elements (promoter+RBS in several combinations) and the enzyme activities were measured and exploited to identify a mathematical model able to predict the behaviour of the controlled system. These predictions made possible an in silico rational fine tuning of the circuit: the most promising modules were selected and assembled into the final circuit, avoiding a cost and time expensive combinatorial approach. \n",

In addition, both bacterial cells activate,  through AHL, an enzyme necessary to convert cellobiose to glucose, which represents the only energy source for the whole consortium. The eukaryotic cell \u2018C\u2019 responds to AHL through a hybrid protein, thereby producing a secreted beta-lactamase, which allows the bacterial cells to grow in the presence of ampicillin. The creation of a consortium of inter-dependent cells from different kingdoms is expected to pave the way to multiple applications, since different cells might cooperate and, for instance, better produce complex molecules.\n",

In order to provide our E. coli host with the right environment required for population-wide oscillations, we designed and manufactured a custom flow-chamber capable of maintaining a defined cell population while independently varying the growth conditions. The chamber was specifically designed for time-lapse studies with a fluorescence microscope.

        "abstract": "Our goal is to set up an easy and quick protocol for cell free cloning. It skips plasmid propagation in bacteria. This speeds up the cloning procedure at least three times and allows cloning of toxic genes. We make sure that no bacteria get harmed during our project. Moreover we have measured the RBS parts with various fluorescent proteins and they are not as standard as we would like them to be. The strength of a RBS part depends on the protein used. Why? Because the beginning of the protein influences the mRNA fold. We came up with the idea of RBS parts fused with short 'protein beginnings' -  expression adapters. Using genetic algorithm we designed expression adapters that would provide standardized protein expression or increase expression of your favorite protein. We are testing our design in the wet lab. \n",

        "track": "New Application", 
        "abstract": "Bacterial chemotaxis is controlled via a signalling cascade, where CheZ is a protein integral in the directed movement of bacteria towards a stimulus. The aim was to control chemotaxis such that bacteria will be attracted to a defined substance followed by the ability to travel back to another stimulus at the start location, upon activation of an IPTG inducible toggle switch. Two riboswitches were used to control the translation of a CheZ fluorescent protein fusion, the first sensitive to theophylline and the second to atrazine. Fluorometry was used to prove the activation of the riboswitches. A theophylline concentration of 1.5mM resulted in the highest expression of the fusion protein. Motility experiments indicated that CheZ mutants regained motility in the presence of theophylline. Since riboswitches can be engineered for many substances, this system has possible applications as a networking template in multiple situations, be they industrial or medical.\n",
