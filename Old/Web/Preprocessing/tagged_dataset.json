To engineer bacteria we designed a genetic flip-flop composed of a binary memory (toggle switch) and an UV sensitive trigger. We chose UV to have a fine spatial selectivity in programming the cells and IPTG  to reset the memory. We designed a circuit with high UV sensitivity by computer-model analysis. Core elements of the genetic memory are two mutually regulated promoters, designed as independent operator sites flanking a constitutive promoter. Thus, promoter transcriptional strength and repressor binding affinity can be independently fixed. Operator libraries for LacI, TetR, Lambda and LexA repressors were cloned as BioBricks to allow the rational design of regulated promoters that is still lacking in the Registry We expect this approach to be a benefit in many  Synthetic Biology applications.\n",

Firstly, biologically produced plastics such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are superior to petroleum-based plastics because they are both biodegradable and biocompatible. By focusing on modulating the ratio of two PHA monomers, 3-hydroxybutyrate and 4-hydroxybutyrate, the copolymer poly(3HB-co-4HB) can be created featuring increased elasticity and utility over any particular PHA monomer. Secondly, a novel polyethylene-degradation pathway is being engineered based on the oxidation of long-chain alkanes by alkane monooxygenase LadA. The region inhibiting the binding and catalysis of polyethylene has been computationally identified and site-directed mutagenesis is being conducted at this region to yield a mutant of LadA that oxidizes polyethylene and thereby increases its biodegradability. The combination of the production of an eco-friendly bioplastic with the degradation of petroleum-based plastics is a promising method of waste reduction.\n",

It has been shown that simple networks can form both static and dynamic patterns.

Upon introduction in E.coli, the system can sense the relative amounts of two input molecules.

Switching is achieved by directed degradation of transcription factors at a specific time frame within the cell cycle. This should result in a binary expression pattern like for example GFP expression in every other cell cycle (0-1-0-1).

Reciprocal inhibition using two repressors shall achieve unilateral expression of the \"switch\", with fluorescence reporters indicating the probability of each alternative occurrence. Balancing the two sets of affinity and kinetic parameters and maintaining a single copy of this synthetic device integrated into the bacterial chromosome shall improve performance. If successful, coupled with other reporters we envision multiple extensions of this \"Randomizer\", including a Memorizer that utilizes a hierarchy of XOR-calculations to \"store\" a multi-digit random number, and intriguing pattern generation involving chemical gradients and random \"population behavior\".\n",

The HKU iGEM2008 team aims to generate unique patterns by rewiring the genetic circuitry controlling cell motility.  Specifically, E. coli cells are programmed to autonomously regulate their movement by sensing local cell density.  Interesting patterns are formed by two types of newly engineered cells.  The high cell-density motility-off cells spread outwards and spontaneously form a distinctive ring of low cell density surrounded by rings of high cell density whilst the high cell-density motility-on cells form a Fuji-mountain-like structure.  Moreover, we build a theoretical model that satisfactorily fits our current experimental data, and also predicts some parameters which may significantly affect the ring formation.  The study of this self-organized spatial distribution of cells helps us to understand principles underlying the formation of natural biological patterns, and synthetic non-natural patterns have various potential applied uses.\n",

We are also pursuing similar diagnostic objectives using a eukaryotic system; we are designing strains of yeast able to respond specifically to immunogenic epitopes or antibodies, and activate a fluorometric or enzymatic response accordingly.

To do this, a molecular timer registers the time since the last disease signal sensed. But when the disease flares up again, this timer is reset and drug production is resumed.

Such a thermometer can be applied as a temperature reporter system in large-scale fermentations, or as a temperature-inducible protein production system. The functionality of this thermometer relies on the post-transcriptional regulation of a temperature-sensitive RNA structure. It opens and enables the ribosome to bind, only when the temperature exceeds a certain threshold. We designed new artificial temperature sensitive RNA sequences, and developed protocols, using luciferase as a reporter, to test their functionality. For the colour output, we built upon the existing carotene biosynthesis pathway and converted all new elements to the BioBrick standard. Furthermore, we developed mathematical models describing both the temperature sensitive parts and the colour mevalonate pathway, and estimated parameters using the experimental data. The ethical issues in design and possible implementation of a commercial product are also addressed.\n",

        "abstract": "The cells of higher eukaryotes utilize chromatin state to encode \"permanent\" epigenetic changes in gene expression.  For example, signals received by a cell during the course of development can induce the partitioning of the genome into accessible (euchromatin) and inaccessible (heterochromatin) regions that specify the fate of that cell.  This epigenetic profile, in which blocks of gene are \"silenced\" by heterochromatin, is stably maintained and inherited by daughter cells.  Thus, chromatin state provides a higher level of gene expression control that is regional (many genes at once), dominant over transcription factors, ultra-cooperative (all or none), and highly stable (memory).  We have constructed and characterized a synthetic silencing system in S. cerevisiae that inducibly silences specific loci in the genome. This foundational technology will facilitate the construction of complex genetic circuits with memory, and has potential application in the engineering of cell differentiation in higher eukaryotes.\n",

We have taken our first steps towards these goals by directing our efforts to the rational refactoring of the E. coli genome.

We have developed and validated a rapid, modular biofabrication method (BioBytes) and have produced BioBytes for 150 of  our 447 essential gene list.

The choice of input channel in multiplexing and output channel in demultiplexing is controlled by a selector. The devices implementing these functions are called Multiplexer (Mux) and Demultiplexer (Demux) respectively. In a digital framework, signals can only assume 0/1 values and then the two components can be represented as logic networks.

This target includes a region complementary to the TRANS-repressor sequence antisense, ends with RBS, and is assembled upstream of the coding sequence to be silenced. Upon binding of TRANS-repressor and CIS-repressing RNAs, the access to RBS by ribosomes is hampered, silencing translation. Accordingly, the amount of TRANS-repressor controls the translation rate of the regulated gene. The TRANS-repressor sequence was determined by a computational analysis performed to minimize the interference with the genomic mRNAs and to maximize the base-pairing interaction to the CIS-repressing RNA.  The T-REX device is proposed as a universal and fast switch in synthetic gene circuits.\n",

Our system changes a protein sequence to maximize its interaction with a given partner. Proteins with modified sequences are then directed to the bacterial outer membrane, where the best interactors are selected. Protein presented on the cell surface is fused with part of \u03b2-lactamase protein, while its bait is fused with the complementing part of the enzyme and added to medium. The stronger the interaction between proteins of interest, the more efficient the binding of the two halves of  \u03b2-lactamase, leading to resistance to ampicillin and survival. Cells expressing less interacting variants die as they don't achieve sufficient complementation of the reporter enzyme. This allows us to select strains producing interactors for any given bait.\n",

This biological device encompasses two integrated systems: one for metal accumulation, the other for metal-induced buoyancy. The uptake and storage system consists of a metal transporter and metallothioneins (metal binding proteins). The buoyancy system is made up of a metal-induced promoter upstream of a gas vesicle gene cluster. This device can be changed to scavenge for any compound by altering the accumulation and the induction modules. The combination of both systems enables the efficient decontamination of polluted water and sediment in a biological manner. \n",

To permit bacteria to send an optical signal, we expressed in E. coli a red firefly luciferase under IPTG induction. In yeast, we used a yeast-two-hybrid-system based on the interaction between the red-light-sensitive Arabidopsis thaliana phytochrome PhyB and its interacting factor PIF3. Interaction between PhyB and PIF3 is induced by the red light from the bacteria, resulting in transcription of the lacZ gene.

        "abstract": "Sending a message across the ocean\u2026 Outer membrane vesicles (OMV), naturally produced by gram negative bacteria as E. Coli, are strong candidates for long-distance messaging. Our engineered communication platform consists of controlling OMV production by destabilizing membrane integrity through over-expression of specific periplasmic proteins (e.g., TolR). In order to control and modulate message content, we used fusions with OmpA signal sequence and the ClyA hemolysin as delivery tags. A targeting system was developed, based on the outer-membrane expression of Jun/Fos leucine zippers to control the vesicle flux between donor and recipient cells. Once received, the signal from incoming vesicles is transduced through a modified Fec pathway, whereby the receptor is provided by the OMV. Computational models provided insight to all of the above steps. Such reliable communications systems have wide biotechnological implications, ranging from targeted drugs delivery and detoxification to advanced division of labor or even cell-based computing.\n",

To date, it has been difficult to overcome primary brain cancer resulting from GBM, primarily because the cancer-initiating cells are suspected to be highly resistant to current cancer therapies. Specifically, CD133+ cells have shown resistance to hypoxia, irradiation, and some forms of chemotherapy. CD133+ hunting machines will be created by genetically engineering microglial cells (BV-2) with mammalian expression vectors. The project will also take advantage of inherent qualities of the microglia such as constant environmental sensing and quick motility. The engineered BV-2s will be equipped to locate the specific GBMs and label the targeted cells with a tat-GFP fusion protein. It is the goal of this study to show an alternative approach to cancer treatment, and to emphasize the power of biologically available options to fight the disease.\n",

Inflamed endothelial cells express VCAM-1, a receptor normally binds to the leukocyte antigen VLA-4.

From the fact that this mechanism is sensitive to a certain wavelength of light, we hope to create a system that can be sensitive to various wavelengths and hence triggering different protein generation.

In the RPS system three 'species' each produce a different fluorescent protein whose expression is downregulated by a lactone from one of the other 'species' and hence the interaction network is intransitive. Simulations indicate that when this game is played out on culture plates, a range of complex patterns evolve with time. Also, selective patterning of the different 'species' allows for new 'racetrack' or 'playing field' type of interactivity.\n",

The ultimate goal of E. coli Automatic Directed Evolution Machine (E.ADEM) project is to manage the power of evolution, by engineering a robust system framework that can automatically create anything we want in synthetic biology, from various types of parts to complex systems. Each demand can be converted into designing a scoring function to give the evolution process a direction. E.ADEM is designed by implementing evolutionary algorithm back into biology. The core of E.ADEM is a self-adaptive controller that can adjust variation rate and selection pressure, based on fitness score, population size and average fitness score calculated by a quorum sensing device. After comprehensive measurement using constitutive promoter family stimulus signals and modeling of the components, a prototype machine is built. Modular design and PoPS device boundary standard will ensure the extensibility and universality of the machine.\n",

These cells use a common second messenger system, calcium ion, which promotes a defined response when an electrical pulse is supplied to them. Nevertheless, these cultures present several technical disadvantages in order to make a handily use of them. Valencia team uses this property on yeast to produce luminescence as a response to electrical stimulus. This project constitutes the first time in which the electrical response of Saccharomyces and its potential applications are going to be tested. The obtained results will be used to build the first iLCD in history. We will reflect the perception that different groups of people have about Synthetic Biology in the survey ",

This delivery mechanism has the potential to deliver payload to any phagocytic organism with a cholesterol-based membrane.

On an industrial scale, this chemical induction requires large quantities of reagents and extensive purification, while environmental induction requires conditions that can adversely affect cell vitality and yield. To this end, we have designed an E. coli genetic circuit that can pass through four stable states of protein production triggered solely by ON/OFF patterns of light.

The BRIDGE protocol (BioBrick Recombineering In Direct Genome Editing) is a protocol for markerless insertion of BioBricks onto the bacterial chromosome, which will bridge ideas and reality in synthetic biology. Bacterial BRIDGEs aim to foster non-chemical means of communication between bacteria by pairing light-producing and light-sensing BioBricks; future teams may make use of them in a variety of novel applications. Finally, human BRIDGEs examine synthetic biology as ways of thinking and the permeation of human aspects, bridging the so-called 'divides' between disciplines and individuals. The question is... how do you think?\n",

        "abstract": "Alternative Oxidase (AOX) is a terminal oxidase protein found in the respiratory chain of various organisms ranging from aquatic prokaryotes to plants and animals. In the AOX pathway, electrons are transferred from ubiquonone to AOX, and then directly used to reduce oxygen. The drop in the electric potential energy of the electrons transferred from AOX to oxygen is dissipated as heat. Our project has focused on 1) cloning the AOX gene from a thermogenic plant (Sacred Lotus) into E. coli to induce a thermogenic response to a cold-shock, and 2) calculating a theoretical rate of heat production per bacterial colony to select for an appropriate calorimetric technique. Further, numerical methods in MATLAB will be employed to model the steady-state temperature profile of the synthetic bacterial colony, and to potentially corroborate later experimental findings. Engineering a controlled thermogenic response in bacteria could lead to improved bacterial functioning in cold shock environments.\n",

From this data we were able to compute an in silico model integrating binding site properties and knockdown percentages. Thus, the expression level of any gene of choice could be arbitrarily adjusted by employing the corresponding binding site design. To produce tissue specific miRNA gene shuttles, we developed an evolution-based method for synthesis of new adeno associated viruses.

To accomplish this, we are constructing chimeric quorum sensing receptors that can localize on Lactobacillus membrane and detect autoinducing peptides (AIPs) released by S. aureus. The ligand binding to the chimeric receptor will trigger downstream plnABCD pathway and initiate the synthesis and secretion of RNAIII inhibiting peptide (RIP), a heptapeptide with proven effectiveness in attenuating S. aureus virulence. The possibility of achieving this lies in the structural homology of the catalytic domain of the quorum sensing receptors in Lactobacillus and S. aureus. Both receptors belong to the HPK10 subfamily of a two-component histidine kinase family. Attenuation of S. aureus virulence by quorum-sensing inhibitors should not yield a strong selective pressure for development of resistance, and would therefore be an attractive concept for preventive medicine.\n",

First of all, we analyzed the function, structure and operation of the transcription factor MerR, a mercury-responsive regulator in detail via bioware experiments and modeling. Then appropriate topology candidates for proper bioreporters were carefully searched. We selected a candidate and re-designed genetic components to accomplish certain bioreporter function in need, which was verified by following bioware experiments. For bioabsorbents, we engineered MerR into a metal binding peptide. This was followed by inductive expression of engineered peptide on surface, periplasm and cytosol of E.coli. This reverse engineering method was then expanded to lead-responsive regulator, PbrR, to confirm the validness of this method. Results demonstrated that the procedure mentioned above is streamlined enough to construct valid whole-cell bioreporters and bioabsorbents of various heavy metals for field application in the near future.\n",

Plants with inadequate levels of oxygen move from aerobic respiration to alcohol fermentation to sustain their metabolism.  This switch causes the accumulation of byproducts that are detrimental to the plant.  A synthetic biological circuit, centering on the alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) promoter, has been developed indicating when low oxygen levels (&lt; 5% O2) are present in plants.  Similarly, low oxygen zones can develop in solid tumors in numerous mammalian cancer models.  Substantial evidence indicates that hypoxia in tumors initiates angiogenesis, a process that aids in tumor proliferation.  Accordingly, an additional hypoxia-sensitive circuit that up-regulates the activity of a reporter protein in low oxygen (&lt;1% O2) environments has been created for mammalian systems.  The development and characterization of these circuits will provide tools to explore the consequences and identity of hypoxic environments in mammalian and plant systems. \n",

However, many important biological processes are governed by the ratio between the concentrations of multiple chemicals. To create systems capable of responding to more complex input data, the Stanford team designed two types of ratio-measuring sensors. The first sensor utilizes two unique small RNAs to inhibit the transcription of two operons, each responding to an environmental factor and having a specific flourescent protein (or output gene). By manipulating the number of small RNAs produced, a tipping point between outputs can be established for different input ratios. The second sensor uses a phosphorylatable protein to control the transcription rate of an output promoter. By linearly associating two chemical inputs to the production of a kinase and a phosphatase, the ratio of the two environmental factors indirectly dictates the activity of the output promoter.\n",

Our knowledge of metabolic pathways capable of degrading such contaminants (bioremediation) is limited.  However, the known pathways tend to be slow and inefficient.  The breakdown of many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons generates a common intermediate, catechol that is further degraded to Acetyl-CoA.  Metabolic channeling is an effect whereby intermediates are shuttled between enzymes in a pathway circumventing free diffusion into the cytosol.  Here, we present a design, modeling and baseline experiments aimed at demonstrating optimization of catechol degradation using the principle of metabolic channeling in an E. coli proof of concept system.\n",

These types of infections are difficult to diagnose, treat, and eradicate, making the healing process time consuming and resource intensive. The native quorum-sensing unit from S.aureus (the Agr system), will be introduced into a non-pathogenic strain of E.coli. The E.coli will then effectively have the ability to eavesdrop on the activity of the pathogenic organism and emit an indication of the magnitude of the infection in the form of RFP. Using sensitivity tuners the system can be designed such that the response will occur at an exact level, when the size of the population poses a threat to the host. Upon a positive result from a diagnosis, further tests could be done to specify whether MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) or MSSA (Methicillin-sensitive S. aureus) are present.\n",

        "abstract": "Mining extraction and refining processes produce toxic by-products that are often stored in tailings ponds.  Tailings ponds are artificial reservoirs where the by-products such as toxic organic compounds, heavy metals or fine clay particles are stored until they are remediated by industrial treatment or natural degradation, which can require decades.  We are developing the components necessary to create a tailings pond clean up kit for removal of harmful by-products.  The first component uses the xylene degradation pathway of Pseudomonas putida optimized by the use of a protein microcompartment produced from the engineered Aquifex aeolicus protein lumazine synthase.  The second component  removes heavy metals by producing nanoparticles with the Magnetospirillum magneticum protein Mms6.  The third component causes sedimentation of fine clay particles using natural properties of Eschericia coli and cell aggregation with Antigen 43.  The final component removes the genetically modified organism\u2019s DNA by using restriction endonucleases.\n",

Both signaling systems were modified to activate orthogonal genetic circuits, allowing for processing and integration of numerous signals. In order to facilitate and maintain pattern formation, we introduced cadherin, a natural intercellular glue. To understand and predict multicellular behavior, we developed a simulation framework based on the Synthetic Biology Open Language and CompuCell 3D modeling environment. Our models motivated several circuit designs we subsequently tested in the laboratory. Altogether, our developments establish a paradigm for manipulation of intercellular communication systems to drive self-organization of tissues.\n",

The problems are reduction in land available for food production, relatively low levels of CO2 biofixation, and large biomass requirements. Our project aims to overcome these problems by utilizing E. coli for the production of biodiesel (C-12 fatty acids) and bioethanol. There have been a number of examples of biofuel production in E. coli; however 30-40% of production cost is based on media costs. Our project will surmount these high production costs by engineering the cyanobacteria, Synechocystis PCC6803, to secrete large quantities of glucose that will feed our biofuel-producing E .coli. Cyanobacteria and E.coli will be co-cultivated to allow the mutual transfer of carbon to produce biofuels.  This project provides an efficient means for producing biofuels without a carbon source.  It will also create a novel cooperative system between bacterial species that may have further industrial implications.\n",

To realize our objective, we harnessed the native cell signaling and quorum sensing machinery of P. aeruginosa.  Quorum sensing in P. aeruginosa is a complex hierarchy that governs the expression of numerous virulence genes.

The Sender Cell expresses a 480nm light emitting protein. The Receiver Cell expresses Channelrhodopsin-2, an ion channel gated by 480nm light. When the Receiver Cell is illuminated, Channelrhodopsin-2 opens, triggering a second luminescent protein via calcium influx. Since the luciferases in this system require an externally added luciferin substrate, we have also been developing Pre-coelenterazine, a genetically encoded luciferin which could allow our system to function autonomously. Our light signaling system has eventual applications in interkingdom signaling and optical controlling of synthetic networks.\n",

        "abstract": "We use a synthetic biology approach to promote tissue regeneration at traumatic wound sites. Tissue regeneration is composed of three primary processes: the regrowth of functional parenchymal tissue, the regrowth of support tissues, and the regrowth of vasculature to sustain the nascent tissue formation (angiogenesis).\nAlthough tissue engineering has offered several effective solutions to address the first two processes, our project attempts to build upon these ideas and develop a more cost-effective and robust method to promote angiogenesis at traumatic wound sites.  We have devised a circuit to be incorporated in a yeast chassis that efficiently expresses two vital angiogenic proteins--vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF-B)--in a sequential and time-dependent manner that approximates the natural cascade of growth factor release in the human body. We also intend to submit a Biobrick-compatible yeast plasmid backbone for future use.\n",

The WashU iGEM team hopes to address this issue by creating a transgenic strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker\u2019s yeast) that produces \u03b2-carotene, the precursor to vitamin A. The WashU team created four DNA constructs for homologous recombination into the S. cerevisiae genome that will catalyze the production of \u03b2-carotene. Each construct consisted of a gene encoding an enzyme from Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous, a bacterium that produces \u03b2-carotene. Three of the constructs encode for enzymes in the metabolic pathway required for \u03b2-carotene production, while a fourth enzyme cleaves \u03b2-carotene to form \u03b2-ionone, a rose-scented compound used in the fragrance industry. Additionally, the WashU team has established spectraphotometric assays to detect \u03b2-carotene and \u03b2-ionone in yeast extract.

Through expression of heterologous genes, E. coli strains which appear to have a response to a specific biofuel were generated. However, these biosensors did not produce the low uninduced and high induced levels of expression desired. This situation appears to be common among biosensor-based iGEM projects. In order to improve the biofuel sensors, as well as provide a framework for other teams to do the same, a universal biosensor directed evolution construct was assembled. The device can be used to both select for high expression in the presence of an analyte, as well as select for no expression in its absence. In conjunction with mutagenesis of key genes, this device could be used to significantly improve existing and novel biosensors. \n",

The translation of the protein can be finely turned up/down with the control of the number of rare codons and the different strength of tRNA induction. Besides, our device can be made into a real switch that can be turned on/off without background protein expression in two ways. One is to use any codon but initial codons to initiate translation, the other is to use stop codon as the controlling element. Moreover, our design would be a brand-new way to selectively express part of a gene or introduce point mutations into target residues in proteins, thus favoring the study of the important domains or residues of a target protein. \n",

Ethanol fermented by yeast from lignocellulosic materials can be an environmentally friendly fuel.

Inhibitors strongly affect the normal physiology of yeast as well as its ethanol productivity, just like the dementors taking away people\u2019s hope and happiness. Nevertheless, we reconstruct TOR protein, a central component of major signaling transduction network controlling cell growth, to increase the tolerance of yeast. A new TOR after directional mutation will play the role of patronus to defend the influence of inhibitors, keep the overall signaling networks in good order, and finally provide a prosperous world for ethanol production. \n",

Heavy metal ions, such as Zn2+, Cd2+, and As2+, that are taken up by the cell will be trapped inside the tank by a metallothionein fused to a BMC-localizing tag. Using BMC in such a way will be very advantageous as it may achieve the accumulation of high concentrations of heavy metals in one place.

Our goal is to create a new assembly standard of biological parts in the form of pre-produced PCR-products, which can be directly mixed with a vector. This will make synthetic biology faster and assembly of an expression vector possible within a few hours. We have created a library of standardized biological parts for mammalian cells and fungi ready to plug\u2018n\u2019play. The simple and easy use of this new assembly system have been demonstrated by developing a reporter targeting system a mammalian cell line as well as for fungi. This novel assembly system represents an improvement of the conventional BioBrick assembly, which have its limits when creating synthetic biology with eukaryotic parts.\n",

Here, a synthetic microcompartment (\u201cThe Sphereactor\u201d) was designed and built. This was assisted by the creation of new mobile apps and web-based tools for DNA analysis. A synthetic operon was constructed, based on the pduABJKNTU genes from Salmonella, that assembled into the empty Sphereactor, which was also affinity-tagged to allow its isolation for downstream applications. A new targeting sequence comprising 20 residues of PduD was shown to target GFP into The Sphereactor. Attempts were made to pack the Sphereactor with many other proteins. Together, the Sphereactor and its new targeting sequence is a foundational advance that could influence the design of new metabolic pathways or inspire new bioremediation or biomedical projects.\n",

We investigate two methods of bringing the enzymes close together: cell surface display via Ice Nucleation Protein, and phage display via M13's major coat protein. We attempt a new DNA assembly protocol, provisionally named \"BioSandwich\". We construct computer models of synergy.

The controlled variable (3OC6-HSL) increases as a function of the exogenous anhydroTetracycline input, that triggers LuxI expression. The controller senses the 3OC6-HSL concentration and activates the production of AiiA, that degrades it.\nTo observe the desired behaviour, a fine tuning of the system was necessary.  The transcriptional/translational strength of the regulatory elements (promoter+RBS in several combinations) and the enzyme activities were measured and exploited to identify a mathematical model able to predict the behaviour of the controlled system. These predictions made possible an in silico rational fine tuning of the circuit: the most promising modules were selected and assembled into the final circuit, avoiding a cost and time expensive combinatorial approach. \n",

        "abstract": "Water Colicin Cleaner is a biological alternative for disinfecting contaminated water using synthetic biology. We kill targeted pathogens by means of antimicrobial peptides in Escherichia coli. As a proof of concept we have chosen to aim for enterobacteria, focusing on E. coli contamined water, as a proxy of fecal water. The cleaning of E. coli will be possible thanks to the colicin protein. The activity of these proteins will be controlled by a biological pH-stat, using light-driven cyanobacteria to control pH of the media.\nWe will deliver a DIY kit as a prototype platform for killing pathogens responsible of diseases such as cholera, diarrhea and typhoid fever, ending with more than 2 million deaths in the last year according to the 2011 WHO Guidelines for Drinking-Water Quality.\n",

        "abstract": "Our goal is to set up an easy and quick protocol for cell free cloning. It skips plasmid propagation in bacteria. This speeds up the cloning procedure at least three times and allows cloning of toxic genes. We make sure that no bacteria get harmed during our project. Moreover we have measured the RBS parts with various fluorescent proteins and they are not as standard as we would like them to be. The strength of a RBS part depends on the protein used. Why? Because the beginning of the protein influences the mRNA fold. We came up with the idea of RBS parts fused with short 'protein beginnings' -  expression adapters. Using genetic algorithm we designed expression adapters that would provide standardized protein expression or increase expression of your favorite protein. We are testing our design in the wet lab. \n",
